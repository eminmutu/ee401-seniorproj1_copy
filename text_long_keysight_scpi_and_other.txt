Web Interface
The instrument includes a built-in Web Interface. You can use this interface over LAN for remote
instrument access and control via Java™-enabled Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.
For waveform generators running firmware version 5.0 and above, Java™ is no longer required for the
remote interface WebUI. To connect, simply enter the instrument's IP address or hostname in your
browser's address bar and press Enter.
If you see an error indicating 400: Bad Request, that is related to an issue with "cookies" in
your Web browser. To avoid this issue, either start the Web interface by using the IP address
(not hostname) in the address bar), or clear cookies from your browser immediately before
starting the Web interface.

To use the Web Interface:
1. Establish a LAN connection from your PC to the instrument.
2. Open your PC's Web browser.
3. Launch the instrument's Web Interface by entering the instrument's IP address or its fully-qualified
hostname, in the browser address field.
4. When you click the Instrument tab, the instrument will ask you for a password (default is keysight),
and then it will open a new page.
5. Follow the directions in the Web Interface's on-line help.

The instrument may be used with mains power of either 100-240 V, 50/60 Hz or 100-120 V, 400 Hz. The
maximum power usage is 150 VA. Mains supply voltage fluctuations are not to exceed 10% of the nominal
supply voltage. Ensure that you are using the correctly rated mains cord based on the instrument’s rating
and your country's electrical codes. Connect the power cord and LAN, GPIB, or USB cable as desired.
Turn the instrument on by pressing the power switch in the lower left corner of front panel. The instrument runs a power-on self test and then displays a message about how to obtain help, along with the current IP address. It also displays the GPIB address if the GPIB option is installed and enabled.

Power Switch:

The instrument's default function is a 1 kHz, 100 mVpp sine wave (into a 50 Ω termination). At power-on,
the channel output connectors are disabled. To enable output on a channel connector, press the key
above the channel connector and then press the Output Off / On softkey.
If the instrument does not turn on, verify that the power cord is firmly connected. Also make sure that the
instrument is connected to an energized power source. If the LED below the power switch is off, there is
no AC power connected. If the LED is amber, the instrument is in standby mode with AC power connected, and if it is green, the instrument is on.
If the power-on self test fails, the display shows ERR in the upper right corner. It also prominently displays
"Check for error messages in the error queue."
See SCPI Error Messages for information on error codes. See Service and Repair - Introduction for instructions on returning the instrument for service.
To turn off the instrument, hold the power switch down for about 500 ms. This prevents you from turning
the instrument off by accidentally brushing the power switch.

Select Output Termination
The instrument has a fixed series output impedance of 50 Ω to the front panel channel connectors. If the
actual load impedance differs from the value specified, the displayed amplitude and offset levels will be
incorrect. The load impedance setting is simply a convenience to ensure that the displayed voltage
matches the expected load.
1. Press a channel output key to open the channel configuration screen. Note that the current output termination values (both 50 Ω in this case) appear on the tabs at the top of the screen.
2. Begin specifying the output termination by pressing Output Load.

3. Select the desired output termination either by using the knob or numeric keypad to select the
desired load impedance or by pressing Set to 50 Ω or Set to High Z.

Reset the Instrument
To reset the instrument to its factory default state, press [System] > Set to Defaults > Yes.

Output a Modulated Waveform
A modulated waveform consists of a carrier waveform and a modulating waveform. In AM (amplitude modulation), the carrier amplitude is varied by the modulating waveform. For this example, you will output an
AM waveform with 80% modulation depth. The carrier will be a 5 kHz sine wave and the modulating waveform will be a 200 Hz sine wave.

1. Select the function, frequency, and carrier amplitude.
Press [Waveforms] > Sine. Press the Frequency, Amplitude, and Offset softkeys to configure the carrier waveform. For this example, select a 5 kHz sine wave with an amplitude of 5 Vpp, with 0 V offset.
Note that you may specify amplitude in Vpp, Vrms or dBm.
2. Select AM.
Press [Modulate] and then select AM using the Type softkey. Then press the Modulate softkey to turn
modulation on. Notice that the [Modulate] key is illuminated, and the status message "AM Modulated
by Sine" appears at the top left of the display.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Operating Information

Output an FSK Waveform
You can configure the instrument to "shift" its output frequency between two preset values (called the
"carrier frequency" and the "hop frequency") using FSK modulation. The rate at which the output shifts
between these two frequencies is determined by the internal rate generator or the signal level on the
rear-panel Ext Trig connector. For this example, you will set the "carrier" frequency to 5 kHz and the
"hop" frequency to 500 Hz, with an FSK rate of 100 Hz.

1. Select the function, frequency, and carrier amplitude.
Press [Waveforms] > Sine. Press the Frequency, Amplitude, and Offset softkeys to configure the carrier waveform. For this example, select a 5 kHz sine wave with an amplitude of 5 Vpp, with 0 V offset.
2. Select FSK.
Press [Modulate] and then select FSK using the Type softkey. Then press the Modulate softkey to
turn modulation on. Notice the status message "FSK Modulated" at the top left of the display.
3. Set the "hop" frequency.
Press the Hop Freq softkey and then set the value to 500 Hz using the numeric keypad or the knob
and arrows. If you use the numeric keypad, be sure to finish the entry by pressing Hz.

4. Set the FSK "shift" rate.
Press the FSK Rate softkey and then set the value to 100 Hz using the numeric keypad or the knob

Operating Information

Output a PWM Waveform
You can configure the instrument to output a pulse width modulated (PWM) waveform. PWM is only available for the Pulse waveform, and the pulse width varies according to the modulating signal. The amount
by which the pulse width varies is called the width deviation, and it can be specified as a percentage of
the waveform period (that is, duty cycle) or in units of time. For example, if you specify a pulse with 20%
duty cycle and then enable PWM with a 5% deviation, the duty cycle varies from 15% to 25% under control of the modulating signal.
To change from pulse width to pulse duty cycle, press [Units].
For this example, you will specify a pulse width and pulse width deviation for a 1 kHz pulse waveform with
a 5-Hz sine wave modulating waveform.
1. Select the carrier waveform parameters.
Press [Waveforms] > Pulse. Use the Frequency, Amplitude, Offset, Pulse Width and Edge Times
softkeys to configure the carrier waveform. For this example, select a 1 kHz pulse waveform with an
amplitude of 1 Vpp, zero offset, a pulse width of 100 µs, and an edge time of 50 ns (both leading and
trailing).

2. Select PWM.
Press [Modulate] > Type > PWM. Then press the first softkey (Modulate) to turn modulation on.
Notice the status message "PWM Modulated by Sine" in the upper-left corner of the display.

3. Set the width deviation.
Press the Width Dev softkey and set the value to 20 µs using the numeric keypad or the knob and
arrows.

4. Set the modulating frequency.
Press the PWM Freq softkey and then set the value to 5 Hz using the numeric keypad or the knob and
arrows.

5. Select the modulating waveform shape.
Press Shape to select the modulating waveform's shape. For this example, select a sine wave.
To view the actual PWM waveform, you would need to output it to an oscilloscope. If you do this, you will
see how the pulse width varies, in this case, from 80 to 120 µs. At a modulation frequency of 5 Hz, the
deviation is easily visible.

Operating Information

Output a Frequency Sweep
In the frequency sweep mode, the instrument moves from the start frequency to the stop frequency at a
sweep rate, which you specify. You can sweep up or down in frequency, and with either linear or logarithmic spacing, or using a list of frequencies. For this example, you will output a swept sine wave from
50 Hz to 5 kHz.

1. Select the function and amplitude for the sweep.
For sweeps, you can select sine, square, ramp, pulse, triangle, PRBS waveforms, or arbitrary waveforms (noise and DC are not allowed). For this example, select a sine wave with an amplitude of 5
Vpp.

2. Select the sweep mode.
Press [Sweep] and verify that the linear sweep mode is currently selected on the second softkey.
Press the Sweep softkey to turn sweep on. Notice the Linear Sweep status message at the top of the
tab for the current channel. The button is also illuminated.

57

Operating Information
3. Set the start frequency.
Press Start Freq and then set the value to 50 Hz using the numeric keypad or the knob and arrows.

4. Set the stop frequency.
Press Stop Freq and set the value to 5 kHz using the numeric keypad or the knob and arrows.
At this point, the instrument outputs a continuous sweep from 50 Hz to 5 kHz if output is enabled.

You can also set the sweep frequency boundaries of the sweep using a center frequency and frequency
span. These parameters are similar to the start frequency and stop frequency (above) and they provide
added flexibility. To achieve the same results, set the center frequency to 2.525 kHz and the frequency
span to 4.950 kHz.

To generate a frequency sweep, press [Trigger] twice. The first press puts the trigger in manual mode,
and the second one sends a trigger. For more information, see Trigger Sweep or Burst.

Operating Information

Output a Burst Waveform
You can configure the instrument to output a waveform with for a specified number of cycles, called a
burst. You can control the amount of time that elapses between bursts with the internal timer or the signal level on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. For this example, you will output a three-cycle sine wave
with a 20 ms burst period.

1. Select the function and amplitude for the burst.
For burst waveforms, you can select sine, square, ramp, pulse, arbitrary waveforms, triangle, or
PRBS. Noise is allowed only in the "gated" burst mode and DC is not allowed. For this example, select
a sine wave with an amplitude of 5 Vpp.

59

2. Select the burst mode.
Press [Burst] > Burst Off/On. Notice that a status message N Cycle Burst, Trig Imm is shown in the
tab of the current channel.

3. Set the burst count.
Press # of Cycles and set the count to "3" using the numeric keypad or knob. Press Enter to finish
data entry if you are using the numeric keypad.

4. Set the burst period.
Press Burst Period and set the period to 20 ms using the numeric keypad or the knob and arrows. The
burst period sets the time from the start of one burst to the start of the next burst. At this point, the
instrument outputs a continuous three-cycle burst at 20 ms intervals.

You can generate a single burst (with the specified count) by pressing the [Trigger] key. For more information, see Trigger Sweep or Burst.
You can also use the external gate signal to create gated bursts, where a burst is produced while a gate
signal is present on the input.

LAN Configuration Procedure
There are several parameters that you might need to set to establish network communication using the
LAN interface. Primarily, you will need to establish an IP address. You might need to contact your network
administrator for help in establishing communication with the LAN interface.
1. Select the "I/O" menu.
Press [System] > I/O Config.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

70

Operating Information
2. Select the LAN Settings menu.
Press the LAN Settings softkey.
You can select Modify Settings to change the LAN settings, or you can turn LAN Services on and off
or restore the LAN settings to default values.

This screen reflects the 33500 Series display. The 33600 Series also includes a LAN
Status indicator in the upper right corner to indicate whether the LAN connection is good
or faulty.

3. Press Modify Settings.

To access most items on this screen, use the first softkey to switch from DHCP to Manual. With DHCP
on, an IP address will automatically be set by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) when you
connect the instrument to the network, provided the DHCP server is found and is able to do so. DHCP
also automatically deals with the subnet mask and gateway address, if required. This is typically the
easiest way to establish LAN communication for your instrument. All you need to do is leave DHCP
on. Contact your LAN administrator for details.

71

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Operating Information
4. Establish an "IP Setup."
If you are not using DHCP (if the first softkey is set to Manual), you must establish an IP setup, including an IP address, and possibly a subnet mask and gateway address. The IP Address and Subnet
Mask buttons are on the main screen, and you press More to configure the Gateway.

Contact your network administrator for the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway to use. All IP
addresses take the dot-notation form "nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn" where "nnn" in each case is a byte value in
the range 0 through 255. You can enter a new IP address using the numeric keypad (not the knob).
Just type in the numbers and the period delimiters using the keypad. Use the left cursor key as a backspace key. Do not enter leading zeros.
5. Configure the "DNS Setup" (optional)
DNS (Domain Name Service) is an Internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses.
Ask your network administrator whether DNS is in use, and if it is, for the host name, domain name,
and DNS server address to use.
a. Set the "hostname." Press Host Name and enter the hostname. A hostname is the host portion of
the domain name, which is translated into an IP address. The hostname is entered as a string
using the knob and cursor keys to select and change characters. The hostname may include letters, numbers, and dashes ("-"). You can use the keypad for the numeric characters only.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

72

Operating Information
b. Set the "DNS Server" addresses. From the LAN configuration screen, press More to go to the
second of three sets of softkeys.

Enter the Primary DNS and Second DNS. See your network administrator for details.
More about IP Addresses and Dot Notation
Dot-notation addresses ("nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn" where "nnn" is a byte value from 0 to 255) must be expressed
with care, as most PC web software interprets byte values with leading zeros as octal (base 8) numbers.
For example, "192.168.020.011" is actually equivalent to decimal "192.168.16.9" because ".020" is interpreted as "16" expressed in octal, and ".011" as "9". To avoid confusion, use only decimal values from 0 to
255, with no leading zeros.

Set Up an Arbitrary Waveform
The instrument includes an embedded waveform editor that allows you to create and edit arbitrary waveforms. You can create these waveforms by editing voltage values directly or by using an combination of
up to 12 different kinds of standard waveforms.
The following tutorial creates and edits a basic waveform.

Frequency Limitations: Changing functions may change the frequency to meet the new function's frequency limits.

l

Amplitude Limitations: When the output units are Vrms or dBm, changing functions may lower the
amplitude to the maximum for the new function due to variation in waveform shapes. For example, a
5 Vrms square wave (into 50 Ω) changed to a sine will decrease to 3.536 Vrms (sine’s upper limit).

Duty Cycle Limitations: For Square and Pulse, Duty Cycle on the 33500 Series is limited by the 16-ns
minimum pulse width specification. For example, at 1 kHz, Duty Cycle may be set as low as 0.01%,
because that would result in a pulse width of 100 ns. At 1 MHz, the minimum Duty Cycle is 1.6%, and
at 10 MHz it is 16%. Changing to a frequency that cannot produce the current duty cycle will adjust
the duty cycle to meet the minimum pulse width specification.
On the 33500 Series, the minimum pulse width is 16 ns. On the 33600 Series, the minimum pulse
width is 5 ns up to 4 Vpp and 8 ns up to 10 Vpp.

Operating Information
Output Amplitude
The default amplitude is 100 mVpp (into 50 Ω) for all functions.
l

Offset Voltage Limitations: The relationship between amplitude and offset is shown below. Vmax is ±5
V for a 50 Ω load or ±10 V for a high-impedance load.
Vpp < 2(Vmax – |Voffset|)

l

Limits Due to Output Termination: If the amplitude is 10 Vpp and you change the output termination
setting from 50 Ω to "high impedance" (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF), the displayed amplitude doubles to
20 Vpp. Changing from "high impedance" to 50 Ω halves the displayed amplitude. The output termination setting does not affect the actual output voltage; it only changes the values displayed and
queried from the remote interface. Actual output voltage depends on the connected load.

l

Limits Due to Units Selection: Amplitude limits are sometimes determined by the output units selected. This may occur when the units are Vrms or dBm due to the differences in various functions' crest
factors. For example, if you change a 5 Vrms square wave (into 50 Ω) to a sine wave, the instrument
will adjust the amplitude to 3.536 Vrms (the upper limit for sine in Vrms). The remote interface will
also generate a "Settings conflict" error.

l

You can set the output amplitude in Vpp, Vrms, or dBm. You cannot specify output amplitude in dBm
if output termination is set to high impedance. See Output Units for details.

l

Arbitrary Waveform Limitations: For arbitrary waveforms, amplitude is limited if the waveform data
points do not span the full range of the output DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). For example, the
built-in "Sinc" waveform does not use the full range of values, so its maximum amplitude is limited to
6.087 Vpp (into 50 Ω).

l

Changing amplitude may briefly disrupt output at certain voltages due to output attenuator switching. The amplitude is controlled, however, so the output voltage will never exceed the current setting
while switching ranges. To prevent this disruption, disable voltage autoranging using
VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO OFF. The APPLy command automatically enables autoranging.

l

Setting the high and low levels also sets the waveform amplitude and offset. For example, if you set
the high level to +2 V and the low level to -3 V, the resulting amplitude is 5 Vpp, with a -500 mV offset.

l

A DC signal's output level is controlled by the offset voltage (DC Offset Voltage). The DC level may be
between ±5 V into a 50 Ω load or ±10 V with a high-impedance load.

DC Offset Voltage
The default offset is 0 V for all functions.
l

Limits Due to Amplitude: The relationship between offset voltage and output amplitude is shown
below. The peak output voltage (DC plus AC) cannot exceed the instrument output rating (±5 V into
50 Ω load, or ±10 V into an open circuit).

l

The relationship between offset voltage and output amplitude is shown below. Vmax is the maximum
peak voltage for the selected output termination (5 V for a 50 Ω load or 10 V for a high-impedance
load).
|Voffset| < Vmax - Vpp/2
If the specified offset voltage is not valid, the instrument will adjust it to the maximum DC voltage
allowed with the specified amplitude. From the remote interface, a "Data out of range" error will also
be generated.

l

Limits Due to Output Termination: The offset range depends on the output termination setting. For
example, if you set offset to 100 mVDC and then change output termination from 50 Ω to "high impedance," the offset voltage displayed on the front panel doubles to 200 mVDC (no error is generated). If
you change from "high impedance" to 50 Ω, the displayed offset voltage will be halved. See OUTPut
[1|2]:LOAD for details. Changing the output termination setting does not change the voltage present
at the output terminals of the instrument. This only changes the displayed values on the front panel
and the values queried from the remote interface. The voltage present at the instrument's output
depends on the load connected to the instrument. See OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD for details.

l

Arbitrary Waveform Limitations: For arbitrary waveforms, amplitude is limited if the waveform data
points do not span the full range of the output DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). For example, the
built-in "Sinc" waveform does not use the full range of values, so its maximum amplitude is limited to
6.087 Vpp (into 50 Ω).

l

Setting the high and low levels also sets the waveform amplitude and offset. For example, if you set
the high level to +2 V and the low level to -3 V, the resulting amplitude is 5 Vpp, with a -500 mV offset.

l

To output a DC voltage level, select the DC voltage function (FUNCtion DC) and then set the offset
voltage (VOLTage:OFFSet). Valid values are between ±5 VDC into 50 Ω or ±10 VDC into an open circuit. While the instrument is in DC mode, setting amplitude has no effect.

Operating Information
Output Termination
The instrument has a fixed series output impedance of 50 Ω to the front panel channel connectors. If the
actual load impedance differs from the value specified, the displayed amplitude and offset levels will be
incorrect. The load impedance setting is simply a convenience to ensure that the displayed voltage
matches the expected load.
l

Output termination: 1 Ω to 10 kΩ, or infinite. The default is 50 Ω. The tab at the top of each channel
indicates the value of this setting.

l

If you specify a 50 Ω termination but actually terminate into an open circuit, the output will be twice
the value specified. For example, if you set the DC offset to 100 mVDC (and specify a 50 Ω load) but
terminate into an open circuit, the actual offset will be 200 mVDC.

l

Changing output termination setting, adjusts displayed output amplitude and offset (no error is generated). If the amplitude is 10 Vpp and you change the output termination setting from 50 Ω to "high
impedance" (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF), the displayed amplitude doubles to 20 Vpp. Changing from
"high impedance" to 50 Ω halves the displayed amplitude. The output termination setting does not
affect the actual output voltage; it only changes the values displayed and queried from the remote
interface. Actual output voltage depends on the connected load.
The output load can affect signal quality for pulse or other functions with high-speed
transitions. High load resistance can produce reflections.

l

Units are converted to Vpp if output termination is high impedance.

l

You cannot change output termination with voltage limits enabled, because instrument cannot know
which termination setting the limits apply to. Instead, disable voltage limits, set the new termination
value, adjust voltage limits, and re-enable voltage limits.

Sync Output Signal
A sync output is provided on the front panel Sync connector. All of the standard output functions (except
DC and noise) have an associated Sync signal. For applications where you may not want to output the
Sync signal, you can disable the Sync connector. The Sync signal may be derived from either output channel in a two-channel instrument.
General Behavior
l

By default, the Sync signal is derived from channel 1 and is routed to the Sync connector (enabled).

l

When the Sync signal is disabled, the output level on the Sync connector is at a logic "low."

l

The polarity of the Sync signal is specified by OUTPut:SYNC:POLarity {INVerted|NORMal}.

l

Inverting a waveform (see Waveform Polarity), does not invert the associated Sync signal .

l

For sine, pulse, ramp, square, and triangle waves, the Sync signal is a square wave that is "high" in
the first half of the cycle and "low" in the last half. The Sync signal’s voltages are TTL-compatible
when its load impedance exceeds 1 kΩ.

l

For arbitrary waveforms, the Sync signal rises at the beginning of the waveform and falls at the
middle of the arbitrary waveform. You can override this default behavior by using MARKer:POINt to
specify the point within the arbitrary waveform at which the Sync signal transitions to "low."

Modulation
l

For internally-modulated AM, FM, PM, and PWM, the Sync signal is normally referenced to the modulating waveform (not the carrier) and is a square waveform with a 50% duty cycle. The Sync signal is
a TTL "high" during the first half of the modulating waveform. You can set up the Sync signal to follow
the carrier waveform by using the command OUTPut:SYNC:MODE {CARRier|NORMal|MARKer} when
modulating with internal modulation.

l

For externally-modulated AM, FM, PM, and PWM, the Sync signal is referenced to the carrier waveform (not the modulating waveform) and is a square waveform with a 50% duty cycle.

l

You can override normal sync behavior to force Sync to always follow the carrier waveform (OUTPut
[1|2]:SYNC:MODE CARRier).

l

For FSK, the Sync signal is referenced to the FSK rate. The Sync signal is a TTL "high" on the transition to the "hop" frequency.

Sweep
l

The Sync signal is a TTL "high" at the beginning of the sweep and goes "low" at the sweep's midpoint.
The Sync signal is synchronized with the sweep, but is not equal to the sweep time because its timing
includes the re-arm time.

l

For frequency sweeps with Marker On, the Sync signal is a TTL "high" at the beginning of the sweep
and a "low" at the marker frequency. You can change this with OUTPut[1|2]:SYNC:MODE MARKER.

99

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Operating Information
Burst
l

For a triggered burst, the Sync signal is a TTL "high" when the burst begins. The Sync signal is a TTL
"low" at the end of the specified number of cycles (may not be the zero-crossing point if the waveform has an associated start phase). For an infinite count burst, the Sync signal is the same as for a
continuous waveform.

l

For an externally-gated burst, the Sync signal follows the external gate signal. However, the signal
will not go "low" until the end of the last cycle (may not be a zero-crossing if the waveform has an
associated start phase).

Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM)
A modulated waveform consists of a carrier waveform and a modulating waveform. In AM, the carrier amplitude is varied by the voltage level of the modulating waveform. In FM, the carrier frequency is varied by
the voltage level of the modulating waveform. The instrument accepts an internal or external modulation
source. On a two-channel instrument, one channel can modulate the other.
Select AM or FM before setting up any other modulation parameter. For more information on modulation,
see Modulation.
To Select AM or FM
l

The instrument allows only one modulation mode to be enabled on a channel. When you enable AM
or FM, all other modulations are off. On two-channel models, the two channels’ modulations are independent from one another, and the instrument can add modulated waveforms from two channels.
See PHASe:SYNChronize and COMBine:FEED for details.

With the External source, an external waveform modulates the carrier waveform. The modulation
depth (AM) or frequency deviation (FM) is controlled by the signal level on the rear-panel Modulation
In connector. The external modulation input has -3 dB bandwidth of 100 kHz.

l

AM example: with modulation depth 100%, when the modulating signal is at +5 V, the output will be
at the maximum amplitude. When the modulating signal at -5 V, the output will be at minimum amplitude.

l

FM example: with deviation of 10 kHz, then a +5 V signal level corresponds to a 10 kHz increase in frequency. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation and negative signal levels reduce the frequency below the carrier frequency.

Phase Modulation (PM)
A modulated waveform consists of a carrier waveform and a modulating waveform. PM is very similar to
FM, but in PM the phase of the modulated waveform is varied by the instantaneous voltage of the modulating waveform.

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
This section discusses PWM, which stands for pulse-width modulation. PWM is only available for the
Pulse waveform, and the pulse width varies according to the modulating signal. The amount by which the
pulse width varies is called the width deviation, and it can be specified as a percentage of the waveform
period (that is, duty cycle) or in units of time. For example, if you specify a pulse with 20% duty cycle and
then enable PWM with a 5% deviation, the duty cycle varies from 15% to 25% under control of the modulating signal.

Burst Count
Number of cycles (1 to 100,000,000 or infinite) to be output per burst. Used in the triggered burst mode
only (internal or external source).
l

With the Immediate trigger source, the specified number of cycles are output continuously at a rate
determined by the burst period. The burst period is the time between the starts of consecutive bursts.
Also, the burst count must be less than the product of burst period and waveform frequency:
Burst Period > (Burst Count)/(Waveform Frequency) + 1µsec (33500 Series)
Burst Period > (Burst Count)/(Waveform Frequency) + 500 ns (33600 Series)

l

The instrument will increase burst period to its maximum value to accommodate specified burst
count (but waveform frequency will not be changed).

l

In gated burst mode, burst count is ignored. However, if you change the burst count from the remote
interface while in the gated mode, the instrument remembers the new count and will use it when the
triggered mode is selected.

Operating Information
Burst Period
Burst period, which is used in internal triggered burst mode only, is the time from the start of one burst to
the start of next burst (1 µs to 8000 s, default 10 ms for the 33500 Series). On the 33600 Series, the range
is from 1 µs to 4000 s, and the default is also 10 ms. Burst period differs from "waveform frequency,"
which specifies the frequency of the bursted signal.
l

Burst period is used only when Immediate triggering is enabled. The burst period is ignored when
manual or external triggering is enabled (or when the gated burst mode is selected).

l

You cannot specify a burst period that is too short for the instrument to output with the specified
burst count and frequency. If the burst period is too short, the instrument will increase it as needed to
continuously re-trigger the burst.

For sine, square, and ramp, 0 degrees is the point at which the waveform crosses 0 V (or DC offset) in
a positive-going direction. For arbitrary waveforms, 0 degrees is the first waveform point. Start phase

next trigger.

l

IMMediate (internal): the instrument outputs continuously when burst mode is enabled. The rate at
which the burst is generated is determined by BURSt:INTernal:PERiod.

l

EXTernal: the instrument accepts a hardware trigger at the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. The instrument outputs one burst of the specified number of cycles each time Ext Trig receives a level transition
with the proper polarity (TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe). External trigger signals during a burst are ignored.

Trigger Out Signal
A "trigger out" signal is provided on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector (used with burst and sweep only).
When enabled, a pulse with either a rising edge (default) or falling edge is output from this connector at
the beginning of the sweep or burst.
l

When the Immediate (internal) trigger source is selected, the instrument outputs a square waveform
with a 50% duty cycle from the Ext Trig connector at the beginning of the sweep or burst. The frequency of the waveform corresponds to the specified burst period or total sweep time.

l

When the External trigger source is selected, the instrument disables the "trigger out" signal. The Ext
Trig connector cannot be used for sweep or burst and trigger out at the same time (an externallytriggered waveform uses the same connector to trigger the sweep or burst).

Triggering
This section describes the instrument's triggering system.
Trigger Overview
This triggering information applies to sweep and burst only. You can issue triggers for sweeps or bursts
using internal triggering, external triggering, timer triggering, or manual triggering.
l

Internal or "automatic" (default): instrument outputs continuously when sweep or burst mode is selected.

l

External: uses rear-panel Ext Trig connector to control sweep or burst. The instrument initiates one
sweep or outputs one burst each time Ext Trig receives a pulse. You can select whether instrument
triggers on rising or falling edge.

l

Manual: triggering initiates one sweep or outputs one burst each time you press [Trigger] on the front
panel.

l

When you sweep a list, trigger moves the waveform to the next frequency in the list.

l

The [Trigger] key is disabled when in remote and when a function other than burst or sweep is currently selected.

Trigger Sources
This triggering information applies to sweep and burst only. You must specify the source from which the
instrument accepts a trigger.
l

Sweep and Burst trigger source: Immediate (default), External, Manual or Timer.

l

The instrument will accept a manual trigger, a hardware trigger from the rear-panel Ext Trig connector, or continuously output sweeps or bursts using an internal trigger. You can also trigger bursts
based on a timer. At power-on, immediate trigger is selected.

Software (Bus) Triggering
Available only from remote interface, this is similar to manual trigger mode from the front panel, but you
trigger the instrument with a bus trigger command. The instrument initiates one sweep or outputs one
burst each time a bus trigger command is received. The key blinks when a bus trigger command is
received.
To select the bus trigger source, send TRIGger:SOURce BUS.

Timer Triggering
The timer trigger mode issues triggers a fixed period apart. To select the bus trigger source, send
TRIGger:SOURce TIMer.
Trigger Input Signal
This rear-panel connector is used in the following modes:
l

Triggered Sweep Mode: Press Trigger Setup > Source Ext, or execute TRIG:SOUR EXT (sweep must
be enabled). When a level transition of the correct polarity is received on the Ext Trig connector,
instrument outputs a single sweep.

l

Externally-Modulated FSK Mode: Press Source or execute FSK:SOUR EXT (FSK must be enabled).
When a low level is present, carrier frequency is output. When a high level is present, hop frequency
is output. Maximum external FSK rate is 100 kHz.

l

Triggered Burst Mode: Press Trigger Setup > Source Ext, or execute TRIG:SOUR EXT (burst must be
enabled). The instrument outputs a waveform with specified number of cycles (burst count) each time
a trigger is received from the specified trigger source.

l

External Gated Burst Mode: Press Gated softkey or execute BURS:MODE GAT with burst enabled.
When external gate signal is true, instrument outputs a continuous waveform. When external gate signal goes false, the current waveform cycle completes and then instrument stops while remaining at
voltage level corresponding to starting burst phase. For noise, output stops as soon as the gate signal
goes false.

Operating Information
Trigger Output Signal
The trigger output signal is chassis referenced, and it is physically next to the external modulation input,
which is floating. Use appropriate care not to touch the two signals simultaneously as you are connecting or
disconnecting these cables. De-energize connections to the instrument output before connecting or disconnecting these cables.
l

A "trigger out" signal is provided on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector (used with burst and sweep
only). When enabled, a pulse with either a rising edge (default) or falling edge is output from this connector at the beginning of the sweep or burst.

The diagram above shows the triggering on the 33500 Series. On the 33600 Series, the
pulse width is 100 ns, and the voltage level is programmable (not necessarily the +3.3 V
shown). See TRIGger:LEVel for details on how to set this value.
l

Internal (immediate) or Timer trigger source: instrument outputs a square wave with a 50% duty
cycle from the Ext Trig connector at the beginning of the sweep or burst. Waveform period equals
specified sweep time or burst period.

l

External trigger source: instrument disables "trigger out" signal. The rear-panel Ext Trig connector
cannot be used for both operations simultaneously (an externally-triggered waveform uses the same
connector to trigger sweep or burst).

Dual Channel Operations
This section covers most topics related to dual channel operation. It does not cover the optional IQ Player.
Entering Dual Channel Operation
You enter dual channel configuration by pressing a channel output button, then More, then Dual Channel.

Frequency Coupling
Frequency coupling allows you to couple frequencies or sample rates between channels, either by a constant ratio or offset between them. Press Freq Cpl to turn frequency coupling on or off, and press Freq Cpl
Settings to configure frequency coupling.
The Freq Cpl Settings softkey opens the menu shown below. The first softkey allows you to specify
whether you want to couple the frequencies with a ratio or an offset, and the second softkey allows you to
specify the ratio or offset.

Amplitude Coupling
Amplitude coupling, enabled by the Ampl Cpl softkey, couples the amplitude and offset voltage between
the channels so that changing the amplitude or offset on one channel affects both channels.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

152

Operating Information
Tracking
Tracking, configured by the Tracking softkey, has three modes: Off, On and Invert. When tracking is off,
the two channels operate independently. When tracking is on, they behave as one channel. The third
mode, Invert, makes the channels’ outputs inverses of each other, resulting in a differential channel using
both outputs.
Combine
The Combine feature combines two outputs into one connector. If you choose CH2 from the Channel 1
menu, they are combined on channel 1; choosing CH1 from the Channel 2 menu combines them on channel 2.
In the image below, the top waveform is a 100 mVpp, 1 kHz sine wave on channel 1, and the bottom waveform is a 100 mVpp, 5 kHz sine wave on channel 2.

The image below shows the two outputs combined on channel 1. Note that the X-axis has been compressed (zoomed out) to show more cycles.

153

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Operating Information
The signals being combined do not have to be of the same type; for example, this image shows the same
5 kHz channel on channel 2 combined with a 100 mVpp square wave on channel 1.

When signals are combined, the DC Offset values are not added together. Only the DC Offset from the
receiving channel is used in the combined output. The figure below shows 50 a mV DC Offset added to
Channel 1. The 50 mV offset added to Channel 2 is ignored.

You may also use Combine with bursts. For example, consider the image below, which includes a 1 kHz
sine wave on channel 1 and three-cycle bursts of a 5 kHz sine wave on channel 2.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

154

Operating Information
When these signals are combined on channel 1, the result is a simple amplitude addition of the two signals, as shown below.

You also can combine the signals on channel 2, as shown below.

IQ Player (Optional)
The optional IQ Player is used to play dual arbitrary waveforms, such as IQ baseband signals.
A dual arbitrary waveform is analogous to a stereo music file. It has two channels of information that contain the same number of samples, always start and end together, and always play at the same sample
rate.
File Formats
The instrument's native .ARB and .BARB files can contain either one or two channels of data. These files
are typically created in Keysight BenchLink Waveform Builder software, and you can directly play them
on the instrument.
You can also directly play files ending in .DAT, .ASC, .I, and .Q. These file formats contain one or two
columns of ASCII numbers ranging between -1.0 and 1.0, in either scientific or decimal notation. The data
represents the relative "shape" of the waveform at the current amplitude range.

System-Related Operations
This section covers instrument state storage, power-down recall, error conditions, self test, and display
control. Though unrelated to waveform generation, these operations are important for instrument operation.
Instrument State Storage
l

There are two ways to store and retrieve instrument states:
l

Named state files, using front panel or MMEMory:STORe:STATe and MMEMory:LOAD:STATe

l

Memory locations 1 through 4, using *SAV and *RCL
For 33600 Series instruments, the state files associated with *SAV and *RCL are saved in
files called STATE_0.STA through STATE_4.STA. These files are located in the Settings directory of internal memory. You can manage these files using MMEMory commands.

l

You can also use special storage location 0 with *SAV and *RCL, but location 0 is overwritten by the
current instrument state on power down.

l

Both state storage methods remember the selected function (including arbitrary waveforms), frequency, amplitude, DC offset, duty cycle, symmetry, and modulation parameters.

l

If you delete an arbitrary waveform from non-volatile memory after storing the instrument state, the
waveform data is lost and the instrument uses "exponential rise" in its place.

l

Stored states are not affected by *RST; a stored state remains until overwritten or specifically
deleted.

On the 33500 Series, there are no user-configurable USB parameters. You can only retrieve the USB ID
string (set by the manufacturer) by using the Show USB Id softkey.
Easy File Access (33600 Series only)

Easy File Access uses media transfer protocol (MTP) to easily download instrument files to your PC. Simply connect the rear-panel USB port on the instrument to a USB port on your PC. The DMM will appear as
a read-only drive on your PC's file system. Note that the instrument's internal storage includes a predefined directory structure, as shown below.

You can use your PC's standard file management features to copy files from the DMM to your PC.
To use Easy File Access at the same time that you are remotely programming the instrument with SCPI over the USB interface (USB SCPI), you must have Keysight IO Libraries
Suite 16.3 or later installed on your PC. You may download the latest version at www.key-

External Timebase Reference
The external 10 MHz reference input BNC connector, both the shell and center pin, on the
rear panel of the instrument is isolated up to ±42 Vpk from chassis. The shell of this BNC connector is isolated from the rest of the instrument. Internal circuitry will attempt to keep the
isolated voltage to within ±42 Vpk to chassis. Attempts to float this input beyond ±42 Vpk
from chassis may destroy the instrument and cause a hazard that could result in personal
injury or death.

171

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Operating Information
The external timebase reference provides rear panel connectors (10 MHz In and 10 MHz Out) and circuitry to allow synchronization between multiple instruments or to an external 10 MHz clock signal. You
can also set the phase offset of the output waveform from the front panel or over the remote interface.
To align the phase of two instruments, use a dual-channel oscilloscope to compare the output signals:
1. Connect the two instruments, with 10 MHz Out connected to 10 MHz In. Use the instrument with the
more precise timebase as the 10 MHz reference output source.

2. Connect instrument outputs to scope channel inputs:

3. Set the same frequency on both instruments. The scope should show the signals to be in sync with
regard frequency, but not phase. (A square wave works well to show the phase difference.)
4. For two-channel instruments, phase sync the two channels to each other. This also synchronizes
each channel’s modulating waveforms to the carrier.

Arbitrary Waveforms
Arbitrary waveforms can meet needs not met by the instrument’s standard waveforms. For example, you
might need a unique stimulus, or you might want to simulate signal imperfections such as overshoot,
ringing, glitching, or noise. Arbitrary waveforms can be very complex, making them suitable for simulating
signals in modern communications systems.
You can create arbitrary waveforms from a minimum of 8 points (33500 Series) or 32 points (33600 Series) up to 1,000,000 points. The instrument stores these numeric data points, known as "samples," in
memory and then converts them into voltages as the waveform is generated. The frequency at which
points are read is the "sample rate," and the waveform frequency equals the sample rate divided by the
number of points in the waveform. For example, suppose a waveform has 40 points and the sample rate is
10 MHz. The frequency would be (10 MHz)/40 = 250 kHz and its period would be 4 µs.
Dual Arbitrary Waveforms
Arbitrary waveforms may be single-channel waveforms, or (with option IQP), they may be dual-channel
arbitrary waveforms, such as IQ baseband signals. A dual arbitrary waveform is analogous to a stereo
music file. It has two channels of information that contain the same number of samples, always start and
end together, and always play at the same sample rate.
You can control the skew and balance between channels on dual arbitrary waveforms either via commands in the SCPI FUNCtion subsystem or via the front panel.
Waveform Filters
The instrument includes two filters to smooth transitions between points as arbitrary waveforms are generated.
l

Normal filter: a wide, flat frequency response, but its step response exhibits overshoot and ringing

l

Step filter: a nearly ideal step response, but with more roll-off in its frequency response than the
Normal filter

l

Off: output changes abruptly between points, with a transition time of approximately 10 ns.

Each filter’s cutoff frequency is a fixed fraction of the waveform’s sample rate. The Normal filter’s
response is -3 dB at 27% of the sample rate and the Step filter’s response is -3 dB at 13% of the sample
rate. For example, for an arbitrary waveform at 100 MSa/s, the Normal filter’s -3 dB frequency bandwidth
is 27 MHz.
Turning the filter off may change the sample rate to a lower rate if the sample rate was greater than 250
MSa/s before the filter was turned off.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Operating Information
Waveform Sequencing Applications
Arbitrary waveform sequences are useful when the waveform you want to generate in two situations:
l

The waveform is very long and contains repetitions of shorter fragments. These fragments can be
repeated any number of times in any order.

l

You need real-time control (triggers) to change from one waveform fragment to another.

For an example of the first case, consider a signal that must play the same introductory waveform several
times, then play three other waveforms once each, and then return to play the first waveform continuously. This might be a simulated modem data packet consisting of an "idle" signal, a header, some
data, a checksum, and a return to the "idle" signal.
This might consist of the following sequence description:
1. Play "idle.arb" 10 times
2. Play "header.arb" once
3. Play "data.arb" once
4. Play "checksum.arb" once
5. Play "idle.arb," repeating indefinitely.
In the second case, you may want to initiate the sending of "header.arb" using an external hardware trigger. This case might use the following description:
1. Play "idle.arb" repeatedly until a trigger is received
2. Play "header.arb" once
3. Play "data.arb" once
4. Play "checksum.arb" once
5. Play "idle.arb," repeating indefinitely.
A sequence file (*.seq) contains the information in the numbered lists, and the arbitrary waveform files
(*.arb) contain the individual waveforms themselves.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

192

Operating Information
Waveform Sequencing Implementation
The instrument can assemble long, complex sequences of arbitrary waveforms (segments). Switching
between segments occurs seamlessly in real time. As an analogy, think of segments as songs in a music
player and sequences as play lists.
Each sequence step specifies a segment and how many times it is played. It also specifies whether the
sequence waits for a trigger before the next step and how the Sync signal is generated on a step-by-step
basis.
For each segment, you can either:
l

play the segment from 1 to 1,000,000 times and then advance to the next step

l

play the segment once and then stop and wait for a trigger before advancing

l

repeat the segment until a trigger occurs and then advance

l

repeat the segment until explicitly stopped

Options for Sync signal generation include:
l

assert Sync at the beginning of the segment

l

negate Sync at the beginning of the segment

l

maintain the current Sync state throughout the segment

l

assert Sync at the beginning of the segment and negate it at a defined point within the segment

To start a sequence on a trigger, place a brief DC waveform of 0 V (or any other desired value) in front of
the other waveforms in the sequence, and set the segment to wait for a trigger before advancing. For
33500 Series instruments, the minimum segment length is 8 Sa, and for 33600 Series instruments, the
minimum segment length is 32 Sa.
If a segment is set up to repeat until a trigger is received, the segment will always finish
before continuing to the next segment. In addition, a short segment may repeat for additional cycles in order to clear the sequence sample buffer before continuing.

Quasi-Gaussian Noise
The Noise waveform is optimized for both quantitative and qualitative statistical properties. It does not
repeat for more than 50 years of continuous operation. Unlike a true gaussian distribution, there is zero
probability of getting a voltage beyond the instrument’s Vpp setting. The crest factor (peak voltage
divided by RMS voltage) is approximately 4.6.
You can vary the Noise bandwidth from 1 mHz to the instrument's maximum bandwidth. The energy in
the noise signal is concentrated in a band from DC to the selected bandwidth, so the signal has greater
spectral density in the band of interest when the bandwidth setting is lower. In audio work, for example,
you might set the bandwidth to 30 kHz, to make the audio band signal strength 30 dB higher than if the
bandwidth were set to 30 MHz.

Operating Information

PRBS
A Pseudo-Random Bit Sequence (PRBS) has two levels (high and low), and it switches between them in a
manner that is difficult to predict without knowing the sequence generation algorithm. A PRBS is generated by a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR), shown below.

An LFSR is specified by the number of stages it contains and which stages ("taps") feed the exclusive-or
(XOR) gates in its feedback network. The PRBS output is taken from the last stage. With properly chosen
taps, an L-stage LFSR produces a repetitive PRBS of length 2L-1. The clocking frequency of the LFSR
determines the "bit rate" of the PRBS.
The 33500 Series models allow you to set L to 7, 9, 11, 15, 20, or 23, resulting in sequences from 127 to
8,388,607 bits in length.
The 33600 Series models allow you to set L to any whole number value from 3 to 32, resulting in
sequences from 7 to 4,294,967,295 bits in length.
The default value for L is 7, resulting in a sequence of 127 bits in length.

Modulation
Amplitude Modulation (AM)
The instrument implements two forms of AM:
l

Double-sideband full-carrier (DSB-FC), which has an ITU designation of A3E and is used in AM broadcasting.
The equation for DSB-FC is
y(t)= [(½)+(½)•d•m(t)]•Ac•sin(ωc t)
where
m(t) is the modulating signal
Ac is the carrier amplitude
ωc is the carrier frequency of the carrier
d is the "modulation depth," or fraction of the amplitude range is used by the modulation
For example, a depth setting of 80% varies the amplitude from 10% to 90% of the amplitude setting
(90% - 10% = 80%) with either an internal or a full-scale (±5 V on the 33500 Series, ±5 V or ±1 V on
the 33600 Series) external modulating signal. You may set depth as high as 120%, as long as you do
not exceed the instrument’s maximum output voltage of (±5 V into 50 Ω, ±10 V into high impedance).
The top trace below represents the modulating signal; the bottom trace represents the modulated
carrier.

195

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Operating Information
l

Double-sideband suppressed-carrier (DSSC). Many modern communications systems employ DSSC
on each of two carriers that have the same frequency but a 90-degree phase difference. This is called
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).
The equation for DSSC is y(t)=d•m(t)•sin(ωc t)
In DSB-SC, the carrier signal is inverted whenever m(t) < 0. For QAM, the second carrier signal would
be cos(ωc t), making it 90 degrees out of phase from the first carrier.

Frequency Modulation (FM)
Frequency modulation varies a carrier signal’s frequency according to the modulating signal:
y(t)=Ac•sin[(ωc+d•m(t) )•t]
where m(t) is the modulating signal and d is the frequency deviation. FM is called narrowband if the deviation is less than 1% of the modulating signal’s bandwidth, and wideband otherwise. You can approximate the modulated signal’s bandwidth with the following equations.
BW ≈ 2•(Modulating Signal Bandwidth) for narrowband FM
BW ≈ 2•(Deviation+Modulating Signal Bandwidth) for wideband FM
The top trace below represents the modulating signal; the bottom trace represents the modulated carrier.

Phase Modulation (PM)
PM is similar to FM, but the phase of the carrier waveform is varied, rather than the frequency:
y(t)=sin[ωc t+d•m(t) ]
where m(t) is the modulating signal and d is the phase deviation.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

196

Operating Information
Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) Modulation
FSK is similar to FM, except the carrier frequency alternates between two preset values, the carrier frequency and the hop frequency. Sometimes the hop and carrier frequencies are called "Mark" and
"Space," respectively. The rate at which the switching between these values occurs is determined by an
internal timer or the signal on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. Frequency changes are instantaneous
and phase-continuous.
The internal modulating signal is a square wave with 50% duty cycle.
The top trace below represents the modulating signal; the bottom trace represents the modulated carrier.

Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)
BPSK is similar to FSK, except it is the carrier’s phase, rather than its frequency, that switches between
two values. The rate at which the switching between these values occurs is determined by an internal
timer or the signal on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. Phase changes are instantaneous.
The internal modulating signal is a square wave with 50% duty cycle.
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
PWM is only available for the Pulse waveform, and the pulse width varies according to the modulating signal. The amount by which the pulse width varies is called the width deviation, and it can be specified as a
percentage of the waveform period (that is, duty cycle) or in units of time. For example, if you specify a
pulse with 20% duty cycle and then enable PWM with a 5% deviation, the duty cycle varies from 15% to
25% under control of the modulating signal.

197

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Operating Information
Additive Modulation (Sum)
The "Sum" feature adds the modulating signal to the carrier. For example, you can add controlled
amounts of variable-bandwidth noise to a signal or create two-tone signals. The instrument's internal
modulation generator can produce the same continuous waveform as the main generator, so the Sum
function lets you to create many signals that would have required two instruments before.
The Sum feature increases the amplitude of the output signal by the amplitude of the modulating signal.
This might cause the instrument to switch to a higher output-voltage range, resulting in a momentary signal loss. If this is a problem in your application, turn on the Range Hold function. If the voltage increase
could damage your device under test, apply Voltage Limits.

Operating Information

Burst
You can configure the instrument to output a waveform with for a specified number of cycles, called a
burst. You can use burst in one of two modes: N-Cycle Burst (also called "triggered burst") or Gated
Burst.
An N-Cycle burst consists of a specific number of waveform cycles (1 to 1,000,000) and is always initiated
by a trigger event. You can also set the burst count to "Infinite," which results in a continuous waveform
once the instrument is triggered.
In the image below, the top trace is the sync output, and the bottom one is the main output.

Three-Cycle Burst Waveform
For bursts, the trigger source can be an external signal, an internal timer, the key, or a command from the
remote interface. The input for external trigger signals is the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. This connector is referenced to chassis ground (not floating ground). When not used as an input, the Ext Trig connector can be configured as an output to enable the instrument to trigger other instruments at the same
time that its internal trigger occurs.
An N-Cycle burst always begins and ends at the same point in the waveform, called the start phase.
In GATed burst mode, the output waveform is on or off, based on the signal at the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. Select this signal's polarity using BURSt:GATE:POLarity. When the gate signal is true, the instrument outputs a continuous waveform. When the gate signal goes false, the current waveform cycle is
completed and the instrument stops and remains at the voltage level corresponding to the waveform's
starting burst phase. For a noise waveform, the output stops immediately when the gate signal goes
false.

Frequency Sweep
Frequency sweeping is similar to FM, but no modulating waveform is used. Instead, the instrument sets
the output frequency based on either a linear or logarithmic function, or a list of up to 128 user-specified
frequencies. A linear sweep changes the output frequency by a constant number of Hz per second, and a
logarithmic sweep changes the frequency by a constant number of decades per second. Logarithmic
sweeps let you cover wide frequency ranges where resolution at low frequencies could be lost with a linear sweep.
Frequency sweeps are characterized by a sweep time (during which the frequency changes smoothly
from the start frequency to the stop frequency), a hold time (during which the frequency stays at the stop
frequency), and a return time (during which the frequency returns smoothly and linearly to the start frequency). Trigger settings determine when the next sweep begins.

Attributes of AC Signals
The most common AC signal is a sine wave. In fact, any periodic signal can be represented as the sum of
different sine waves. The magnitude of a sine wave is usually specified by its peak, peak-to-peak, or rootmean-square (RMS) value. All of these measures assume that the waveform has zero offset voltage.

A waveform's peak voltage is the maximum absolute value of all of its points. The peak-to-peak voltage is
the difference between the maximum and minimum. The RMS voltage equals the standard deviation of all
waveform points; it also represents the one-cycle average power in the signal, minus the power in any DC
component of the signal. Crest factor is the ratio of a signal’s peak value to its RMS value and varies
according to waveshape. The table below shows several common waveforms with their respective crest
factors and RMS values.

201

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Operating Information
If an average-reading voltmeter is used to measure the "DC voltage" of a waveform, the reading may not
agree with the DC Offset setting. This is because the waveform may have a non-zero average value that
would be added to the DC Offset.
You may occasionally see AC levels specified in "decibels relative to 1 milliwatt" (dBm). Since dBm represents a power level, you need to know the signal’s RMS voltage and the load resistance in order to
make the calculation.
dBm = 10 x log10 (P / 0.001) where P = VRMS2 / RL
For a sine wave into a 50 Ω load, the following table relates dBm to voltage.

Signal Imperfections
For sine waves, common signal imperfections are easiest to describe and observe in the frequency
domain, using a spectrum analyzer. Any output signal component with a frequency different from the fundamental (or "carrier") is considered to be distortion. Those imperfections can be categorized as harmonic distortion, non-harmonic spurious, or phase noise, and they are specified in decibels relative to the
carrier level, or "dBc."
Harmonic Distortion
Harmonic components occur at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency and are usually created
by non-linear components in the signal path. At low signal amplitudes, another possible source of harmonic distortion is the Sync signal, which is a square wave with many strong harmonic components that
can couple into the main signal. Although Sync is highly isolated from the instrument's main signal outputs, coupling can occur in external cabling. For best results, use high-quality coaxial cables with double
or triple shields. If Sync is not required, leave it unconnected or off.
Non-Harmonic Spurious
One source of non-harmonic spurious components (called "spurs") is the digital-to-analog converter
(DAC) that converts the digital waveform values into voltage. Non-linearity in this DAC gives rise to harmonics that can be higher than the Nyquist frequency and will therefore be aliased to a lower frequency.
For example, the fifth harmonic of 30 MHz (150 MHz) could create a spur at 100 MHz.
Another source of non-harmonic spurs is the coupling of unrelated signal sources (such as the embedded
controller’s clocks) into the output signal. These spurs usually have constant amplitude and are most
troublesome at signal amplitudes below 100 mVpp. For optimal signal purity at low amplitudes, keep the
instrument’s output level relatively high and use an external attenuator.
Phase Noise
Phase noise results from small, instantaneous changes in the output frequency ("jitter"). On a spectrum
analyzer, it appears as a rise in the apparent noise floor near the frequency of the output signal. The
phase noise specification represents the amplitudes of the noise in 1 Hz bands located 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and
100 kHz away from a 30-MHz sine wave. Be aware that spectrum analyzers also have phase noise, so the
levels you read may include analyzer phase noise.
Quantization Noise
Finite resolution in the waveform DAC causes voltage quantization errors. Assuming the errors are uniformly distributed over a range of ±0.5 least-significant bit, the equivalent noise level for standard waveforms is approximately -95 dBc. At this level, other sources of noise in the instrument dominate.
Quantization noise can be of concern, though, in arbitrary waveforms that do not use the whole range of
DAC codes (-32767 to +32767). Scale arbitrary waveforms to use the entire range, if possible.

Ground Loops
The signal-generation portion of the instrument is isolated from chassis (earth) ground. This helps eliminate ground loops in your system and also allows you to reference the output signal to voltages other
than ground. The illustration below shows the instrument connected to a load through a coaxial cable.
Any difference in ground potentials (VGND) will tend to drive current IGND through the shield of the cable,
thus causing a voltage drop due to the shield’s impedance (ZSHIELD). This voltage (IGND x ZSHIELD)
appears as an error in the load voltage. However, since the instrument is isolated, there is a high series
impedance (typically >1 MΩ) in parallel with 50 nF) to oppose the flow of IGND and thereby minimize this
effect.

At frequencies above a few kHz, a coaxial cable’s shield becomes inductive, rather than resistive, and the
cable begins to act like a transformer. When this happens, voltage drops in the shield due to IGND tend to
be offset by equal voltages in the center conductor, thereby reducing the effects of ground loops at
higher frequencies. Coaxial cables with two or three braided shields are much better than those with
single- braided or foil shields because they have lower resistance and therefore become transformers at
lower frequencies.
To reduce errors due to ground loops, connect the instrument to the load using a high-quality coaxial
cable and ground it at the load through the cable’s shield. If possible, make sure the instrument and the
load are connected to the same electrical outlet to minimize further differences in ground potential.
Be aware that the outer shells of the Sync and Modulation In connectors are connected to those of the
main output connector(s). Cables attached to Sync and/or Modulation In are therefore potential sources
of ground loops. Also be aware that attempting to drive those connector shells to different voltages can
cause high current to flow through the instrument, possibly causing damage.

SCPI Error Messages

Introduction to the SCPI Language
SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) is an ASCII-based instrument command language designed for test and measurement instruments. SCPI commands are based on a hierarchical structure, also known as a tree system. In this system, associated commands are grouped together under a
common node or root, thus forming subsystems. A portion of the OUTPut subsystem is shown below to
illustrate the tree system.
OUTPut:
SYNC {OFF|0|ON|1}
SYNC:
MODE {NORMal|CARRier}
POLarity {NORMal|INVerted}
OUTPut is the root keyword, SYNC is a second-level keyword, and MODE and POLarity are third-level
keywords. A colon ( : ) separates a command keyword from a lower-level keyword.

Syntax Conventions
The format used to show commands is illustrated below:
[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:UNIT {VPP|VRMS|DBM}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FREQuency:CENTer {<frequency>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
The command syntax shows most commands (and some parameters) as a mixture of upper- and lowercase letters. The upper-case letters indicate the abbreviated spelling for the command. For shorter program lines, you can send the abbreviated form. For better program readability, you can send the long
form.
For example, in the above syntax statement, VOLT and VOLTAGE are both acceptable forms. You can use
upper- or lower-case letters. Therefore, VOLTAGE, volt, and Volt are all acceptable. Other forms, such as
VOL and VOLTAG, are not valid and will generate an error.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

206

SCPI Programming Reference
l

Braces ( { } ) enclose the parameter choices for a given command string. The braces are not sent with
the command string.

l

A vertical bar ( | ) separates multiple parameter choices for a given command string. For example,
{VPP|VRMS|DBM} in the above command indicates that you can specify "VPP", "VRMS", or "DBM".
The bar is not sent with the command string.

l

Triangle brackets in the second example ( < > ) indicate that you must specify a value for the enclosed
parameter. For example, the above syntax statement shows the <frequency> parameter enclosed in
triangle brackets. The brackets are not sent with the command string. You must specify a value for
the parameter (for example "FREQ:CENT 1000") unless you select another option shown in the syntax
(for example "FREQ:CENT MIN").

l

Some syntax elements (for example nodes and parameters) are enclosed in square brackets ( [ ]). This
indicates that the element is optional and can be omitted. The brackets are not sent with the command string. If you do not specify a value for an optional parameter, the instrument chooses a default
value. In the examples above the "SOURce[1|2]" indicates that you may refer to source channel 1
either by "SOURce", or by "SOURce1", or by "SOUR1" or by "SOUR". In addition, since the whole
SOURce node is optional (in brackets) you also may refer to channel 1 by entirely leaving out the
SOURce node. This is because Channel 1 is the default channel for the SOURce language node. On
the other hand, to refer to Channel 2, you must use either "SOURce2" or "SOUR2" in your program
lines.

Command Separators
A colon ( : ) is used to separate a command keyword from a lower-level keyword. You must insert a blank
space to separate a parameter from a command keyword. If a command requires more than one parameter, you must separate adjacent parameters using a comma as shown below:
APPL:SIN 455E3,1.15,0.0
In this example, the APPLy command is specifying a sine wave at a frequency of 455 KHz, with an amplitude of 1.15 volts, and a DC offset of 0.0 volts.
A semicolon ( ; ) is used to separate commands within the same subsystem, and can also minimize typing.
For example, sending the following command string:
TRIG:SOUR EXT; COUNT 10
is the same as sending the following two commands:
TRIG:SOUR EXT
TRIG:COUNT 10

Using the MIN, MAX, and DEF Parameters
For many commands, you can substitute "MIN" or "MAX" in place of a parameter. In some cases you may
also substitute "DEF". For example, consider the following command:
[SOURce[1|2]:]APPLy:DC [{<frequency>|DEF} [,{<amplitude>|DEF} [,{<offset>|MIN|MAX|DEF}]]]

207

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

SCPI Programming Reference
Instead of selecting a specific value for the <offset> parameter, you can substitute MIN to set the offset to
its minimum value, MAX to set the offset to its maximum value. You can also specify DEF to set the
default value for each parameter: <frequency>, <amplitude>, and <offset>.

Querying Parameter Settings
You can query the current value of most parameters by adding a question mark ( ? ) to the command. For
example, the following command sets the trigger count to 10 readings:
TRIG:COUN 10
You can then query the count value by sending:
TRIG:COUN?
You can also query the minimum or maximum count allowed as follows:
TRIG:COUN? MIN
TRIG:COUN? MAX

SCPI Command Terminators
A command string sent to the instrument must terminate with a <new line> (<NL>) character. The IEEE488 EOI (End-Or-Identify) message is interpreted as a <NL> character and can be used to terminate a
command string in place of a <NL> character. A <carriage return> followed by a <NL> is also accepted.
Command string termination will always reset the current SCPI command path to the root level.
For every SCPI message that includes a query and is sent to the instrument, the instrument terminates the returned response with a <NL> or line-feed character (EOI). For
example, if "DISP:TEXT?" is sent, the response is terminated with a <NL> after the
string of data that is returned. If a SCPI message includes multiple queries separated
by semicolons (for example "DISP?;DISP:TEXT?"), the returned response is again terminated by a <NL> after the response to the last query. In either case, the program
must read this <NL> in the response before another command is sent to the instrument, or an error will occur.

IEEE-488.2 Common Commands
The IEEE-488.2 standard defines a set of common commands that perform functions such as reset, selftest, and status operations. Common commands always begin with an asterisk ( * ), are three characters
in length, and may include one or more parameters. The command keyword is separated from the first
parameter by a blank space. Use a semicolon ( ; ) to separate multiple commands as shown below:
*RST; *CLS; *ESE 32; *OPC?

SCPI Programming Reference

SCPI Parameter Types
The SCPI language defines several data formats to be used in program messages and response messages.
Numeric Parameters
Commands that require numeric parameters will accept all commonly used decimal representations of
numbers including optional signs, decimal points, and scientific notation. Special values for numeric parameters such as MIN, MAX, and DEF are also accepted. You can also send engineering unit suffixes with
numeric parameters (e.g., M, k, m, or u). If a command accepts only certain specific values, the instrument will automatically round the input numeric parameters to the accepted values. The following command requires a numeric parameter for the frequency value:
[SOURce[1|2]:]FREQuency:CENTer {<frequency>|MINimum|MAXimum}
Because the SCPI parser is case-insensitive, there is some confusion over the letter
"M" (or "m"). For your convenience, the instrument interprets "mV" (or "MV") as millivolts, but "MHZ" (or "mhz") as megahertz. Likewise "MΩ" (or "mΩ") is interpreted as
megohms. You can use the prefix "MA" for mega. For example, "MAV" is interpreted
as megavolts.

Discrete Parameters
Discrete parameters are used to program settings that have a limited number of values (like IMMediate,
EXTernal, or BUS). They may have a short form and a long form just like command keywords. You can mix
upper- and lower-case letters. Query responses will always return the short form in all upper-case letters.
The following command requires a discrete parameter for the voltage units:
[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:UNIT {VPP|VRMS|DBM}
Boolean Parameters
Boolean parameters represent a single binary condition that is either true or false. For a false condition,
the instrument will accept "OFF" or "0". For a true condition, the instrument will accept "ON" or "1". When
you query a Boolean setting, the instrument will always return "0" or "1". The following command requires
a Boolean parameter:
DISPlay {OFF|0|ON|1}
ASCII String Parameters
String parameters can contain virtually any set of ASCII characters. A string must begin and end with
matching quotes; either with a single quote or a double quote. You can include the quote delimiter as part
of the string by typing it twice without any characters in between. The following command uses a string
parameter:

209

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

SCPI Programming Reference
DISPlay:TEXT <quoted string>
For example, the following command displays the message "WAITING..." on the instrument's front panel
(the quotes are not displayed).
DISP:TEXT "WAITING..."
You can also display the same message using single quotes.
DISP:TEXT 'WAITING...'

Using Device Clear
Device Clear is an IEEE-488 low-level bus message that you can use to return the instrument to a responsive state. Different programming languages and IEEE-488 interface cards provide access to this capability
through their own unique commands. The status registers, the error queue, and all configuration states
are left unchanged when a Device Clear message is received.
Device Clear performs the following actions:
l

If a measurement is in progress, it is aborted.

l

The instrument returns to the trigger "idle" state.

l

The instrument's input and output buffers are cleared.

l

The instrument is prepared to accept a new command string.
The ABORt command is the recommended method to terminate an instrument operation.

Internal Function Waveforms
The following are the internal function waveforms.

l

Halts any triggered action (triggered list, triggered sweep, triggered burst, triggered arbitrary waveform playback).

l

ABORt has no effect when instrument is in normal or modulated modes, except for sequenced arbitrary waveforms, lists, bursts, and sweeps. If instrument is running a sequence, list, burst, or sweep,
ABORt restarts the stopped item with the current INIT and trigger conditions.

l

When ABORt occurs in list mode, the frequency goes back to the "normal" mode frequency until the
first trigger occurs. After the first trigger, the first frequency in the list will be used.

l

If ABORt executed during sweep, sweep returns to starting sweep frequency.

l

ABORt always applies to both channels in a two-channel instrument.

AM Subsystem
The AM subsystem allows you to add amplitude modulation (AM) to a carrier waveform.
Example
To generate an amplitude modulation (AM) waveform:
1. Configure carrier waveform: Use FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage, and VOLTage:OFFSet to specify
the carrier waveform's function, frequency, amplitude, and offset.
2. Select mode of Amplitude Modulation: AM:DSSC
3. Select modulation source (internal, external, CH1, or CH2): AM:SOURce. For an external source, you
can skip steps 4 and 5 below.
4. Select modulating waveform: AM:INTernal:FUNCtion
5. Set modulating frequency: AM:INTernal:FREQuency
6. Set modulation depth: AM[:DEPTh]
7. Enable AM: AM:STATe:ON

l

Even at greater than 100% depth, the instrument will not exceed ±5 V peak on the output (into a 50 Ω
load). To achieve modulation depth greater than 100%, output carrier amplitude may be reduced.

l

With AM:SOURce EXTernal, carrier waveform is modulated with an external waveform. The modulation depth is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (or the optional ±1 V signal level on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if modulation depth (AM[:DEPTh]) is
100%, then when the modulating signal is at +5 V (or optionally +1 V on the 33600 Series), the output
will be at the maximum amplitude. Similarly, a -5 V modulating signal (or optionally -1 V on the
33600 Series) produces output at minimum amplitude.

l

When you select an arbitrary waveform as the modulating source, the frequency changes to the frequency of the arbitrary waveform, which is based on the sample rate and the number of points in the
arbitrary waveform.

l

When using an arbitrary waveform for the modulating source, changing this parameter also changes
the cached metadata representing the arbitrary waveform's sample rate. You can also change the
modulating frequency of an arbitrary waveform with FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FREQuency, FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PERiod, and FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe. These commands and the modulation frequency command are directly coupled in order to keep the arbitrary waveform behaving exactly as it
was last played. If you later turn modulation off and select that same arbitrary waveform as the current function, its sample rate (and corresponding frequency based upon the number of points) will be
the same as it was when played as the modulation source.

l

If the internal function is TRIangle, UpRamp, or DnRamp, the maximum frequency is limited to 200
kHz on the 33500 Series or 800 kHz on the 33600 Series. If the internal function is PRBS, the frequency refers to bit rate and is limited as shown here.

If you select EXTernal, the carrier waveform is modulated with an external waveform. Specifically:
l

AM: The modulation depth is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (or the optional ±1 V signal level
on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if modulation depth
(AM[:DEPTh]) is 100%, then when the modulating signal is at +5 V (or optionally +1 V on the 33600
Series), the output will be at the maximum amplitude. Similarly, a -5 V modulating signal (or
optionally -1 V on the 33600 Series) produces output at minimum amplitude.

l

FM: If you select the External modulating source, the deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal
level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For
example, if the frequency deviation is 100 kHz, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a 100 kHz increase in frequency. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation and negative signal levels reduce the frequency below the carrier frequency.

l

PM: With the External modulating source, deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you
have set the frequency deviation to 180 degrees, then a +5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a +180 degree phase deviation. Lower external signal levels produce
less deviation, and negative signal levels produce negative deviation.

l

Pulse as Selected Function: The pulse width or pulse duty cycle deviation is controlled by the ±5 V
signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) present on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you have set the pulse width deviation to 50 μs using the PWM:DEViation
command, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the 33600 Series) corresponds to a 50 μs
width increase. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation.

l

With EXTernal source, the output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSK) is determined by the signal level
on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. When a logic low is present, the carrier phase or carrier frequency is output. When a logic high is present, the phase shifted phase or hop frequency is output.

l

The maximum external BPSK rate is 1 MHz, and the maximum FSK rate is 1 MHz.

l

Note: the connector used for externally-controlled BPSK or FSK waveforms (Trig In) is not the same
connector that is used for externally-modulated AM, FM, PM, and PWM waveforms (Modulation In).
When used for BPSK or FSK, the Trig In connector does not have adjustable edge polarity and is not
affected by the TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe command.

l

With INTernal source, the rate at which output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSKey) "shifts" between
the carrier phase or frequency and the alternate phase or frequency is determined by the BPSK rate
(BPSK:INTernal:RATE) or FSK rate (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).

l

A channel may not be its own modulation source.

APPLy Subsystem
The APPLy subsystem allows you to configure entire waveforms with one command. The general form of
an APPLy command is shown below:
[SOURce[1|2]:]APPLy:<function> [<frequency> [,<amplitude> [,<offset>]]]
For example,
APPLy:SIN 1e4,1,0.1
replaces the following commands:
FUNCtion SIN
FREQ 1e4
VOLT 1
VOLT:OFF 0.1
OUTP ON
Not only is APPLy shorter, it avoids settings conflicts that occur when sending commands individually. In
addition, APPLy performs the following operations:
l

Sets trigger source to IMMediate (equivalent to TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce IMMediate).

l

Turns off any modulation, sweep, or burst mode currently enabled and places the instrument in continuous waveform mode.

l

Turns on the channel output (OUTPut ON) without changing output termination setting (OUTPut
[1|2]:LOAD).

l

Overrides the voltage autorange setting and enables autoranging (VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO).

The instrument can generate eight types of waveforms: DC voltage, gaussian noise, PRBS, pulse, ramp/triangle wave, sine wave, square wave and arbitrary (user) waveform. Waveform-specific settings exist in
the FUNCtion subsystem.
You can also query current output configuration (APPLy?).
General Remarks
Amplitude
l

221

Changing amplitude may briefly disrupt output at certain voltages due to output attenuator switching. The amplitude is controlled, however, so the output voltage will never exceed the current setting
while switching ranges. To prevent this disruption, disable voltage autoranging using
VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO OFF. The APPLy command automatically enables autoranging.

Limits Due to Output Termination: The offset range depends on the output termination setting. For
example, if you set offset to 100 mVDC and then change output termination from 50 Ω to "high impedance," the offset voltage displayed on the front panel doubles to 200 mVDC (no error is generated). If
you change from "high impedance" to 50 Ω, the displayed offset voltage will be halved. See OUTPut
[1|2]:LOAD for details.

l

Limits Due to Unit Selection: The amplitude limits are determined by the output units selected.

l

You cannot specify output amplitude in dBm if output termination is set to high impedance. The units
are automatically converted to Vpp.

General
l

Setting a sample rate when not in the ARB mode will not change the frequency. For example, if the
current function is sine, setting sample rate has no effect until the function changes to ARB.

l

High sample rates may affect the actual amplitude due to filter roll-off.
Options

l

See FUNCtion: ARBitrary for available arbitrary waveform options. With FUNCtion:ARBitrary, you may
select a built-in arbitrary waveform or the waveform currently downloaded to volatile memory using
MMEMory commands.
Offset Voltage

l

The relationship between offset voltage and output amplitude is shown below. Vmax is the maximum
peak voltage for the selected output termination (5 V for a 50 Ω load or 10 V for a high-impedance
load).
|Voffset| < Vmax - Vpp/2
If the specified offset voltage is not valid, the instrument will adjust it to the maximum DC voltage
allowed with the specified amplitude. From the remote interface, a "Data out of range" error will also
be generated.

l

223

Limits Due to Output Termination: The offset range depends on the output termination setting. For
example, if you set offset to 100 mVDC and then change output termination from 50 Ω to "high impedance," the offset voltage displayed on the front panel doubles to 200 mVDC (no error is generated). If
you change from "high impedance" to 50 Ω, the displayed offset voltage will be halved. See OUTPut

you change from "high impedance" to 50 Ω, the displayed offset voltage will be halved. See OUTPut
[1|2]:LOAD for details. Changing the output termination setting does not change the voltage present
at the output terminals of the instrument. This only changes the displayed values on the front panel
and the values queried from the remote interface. The voltage present at the instrument's output
depends on the load connected to the instrument. See OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD for details.

Typical
Return
(none)

<amplitude> Desired output amplitude in Vpp, Vrms or dBm, as specified by
VOLTage:UNIT. 1 mVpp to 10 Vpp into 50 Ω, or twice that into an open circuit. Default
is 100 mVpp into 50 Ω.

into an open circuit.
Output pseudo-random bit sequence bounded by 3 Vpp, with -2.5 V offset:

Frequency
l

PRBS is generated by a Maximum Length Sequence (MLS) generator (Linear Feedback Shift Register)
which may be configured to several standard configurations. Default is PN7 at 1000 bits/second.

l

A PRBS waveform using polynomial PNx is generated by a shift register of x bits, and the output waveform begins with x sample periods of high output. Sample period is the reciprocal of the sample rate
(FUNCtion:PRBS:BRATe), and the channel's Sync pulse indicates the waveform's start. For example, if
the PRBS uses PN23 with sample rate 500 Hz, the output begins with 46 ms of high output (23 x 2
ms).

l

Unlike the APPLy:NOISe function, the APPLy:PRBS function operates with the Sync output enabled.
The Sync function indicates the beginning of the Pseudo-random function sequence.

BPSK Subsystem
The BPSK subsystem allows you to modulate a waveform with Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), a digital
modulation format. In BPSK, the carrier waveform is phase shifted between two phase settings using an
on/off keying. The source may be internal, using a square wave at a specified frequency, or external,
using the external trigger input.
If the carrier function is an arbitrary waveform, then the phase shift only affects the position of sample
transitions. This is different than shifting the phase of the overall arbitrary waveform.
Example
To generate a BPSK waveform:
1. Configure carrier waveform: Use FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage, and VOLTage:OFFSet to specify
the carrier waveform's function, frequency, amplitude, and offset.
2. Select modulation source (internal, external, CH1, or CH2): BPSK:SOURce. For an external source,
skip steps 3 and 4 below.
3. Select BPSK phase: BPSK[:PHASe]
4. Set BPSK rate: BPSK:INTernal:RATE
5. Enable BPSK Modulation: BPSK:STATe ON
The following code produces the oscilloscope image shown below.

PWM for AM)

233

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

l

If you select EXTernal, the carrier waveform is modulated with an external waveform. Specifically:
l

AM: The modulation depth is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (or the optional ±1 V signal level
on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if modulation depth
(AM[:DEPTh]) is 100%, then when the modulating signal is at +5 V (or optionally +1 V on the 33600
Series), the output will be at the maximum amplitude. Similarly, a -5 V modulating signal (or
optionally -1 V on the 33600 Series) produces output at minimum amplitude.

l

FM: If you select the External modulating source, the deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal
level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For
example, if the frequency deviation is 100 kHz, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a 100 kHz increase in frequency. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation and negative signal levels reduce the frequency below the carrier frequency.

l

PM: With the External modulating source, deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you
have set the frequency deviation to 180 degrees, then a +5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a +180 degree phase deviation. Lower external signal levels produce
less deviation, and negative signal levels produce negative deviation.

l

Pulse as Selected Function: The pulse width or pulse duty cycle deviation is controlled by the ±5 V
signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) present on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you have set the pulse width deviation to 50 μs using the PWM:DEViation
command, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the 33600 Series) corresponds to a 50 μs
width increase. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation.

l

With EXTernal source, the output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSK) is determined by the signal level
on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. When a logic low is present, the carrier phase or carrier frequency is output. When a logic high is present, the phase shifted phase or hop frequency is output.

l

The maximum external BPSK rate is 1 MHz, and the maximum FSK rate is 1 MHz.

l

Note: the connector used for externally-controlled BPSK or FSK waveforms (Trig In) is not the same
connector that is used for externally-modulated AM, FM, PM, and PWM waveforms (Modulation In).
When used for BPSK or FSK, the Trig In connector does not have adjustable edge polarity and is not
affected by the TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe command.

l

With INTernal source, the rate at which output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSKey) "shifts" between
the carrier phase or frequency and the alternate phase or frequency is determined by the BPSK rate
(BPSK:INTernal:RATE) or FSK rate (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).

l

A channel may not be its own modulation source.

BURSt Subsystem
This section describes the BURSt subsystem.
Example
This summarizes the steps required to generate a burst.
1. Configure the burst waveform: Use APPLy or the equivalent FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage, and
VOLTage:OFFSet commands to select the waveform's function, frequency, amplitude, and offset. You
can select a sine, square, triangle, ramp, pulse, PRBS, or arbitrary waveform (noise is allowed only in
the gated burst mode and DC is not allowed). For internally-triggered bursts, the minimum frequency
is 2.001 mHz. For sine and square waveforms, frequencies above 6 MHz are allowed only with an
"infinite" burst count.
2. Select the "triggered" or "gated" burst mode: Select the triggered burst mode (called "N Cycle" on
the front panel) or external gated burst mode using BURSt:MODE. If you are using gated mode, specify true-high or true-low logic with BURSt:GATE:POLarity.
3. Set the burst count: Set the burst count (number of cycles per burst) to any value between 1 and
100,000,000 cycles (or infinite) using the BURSt:NCYCles command. Used in the triggered burst
mode only. In PRBS, BURSt:NCYCles sets the number of bits of PRBS. Each burst starts at the
sequence start.
4. Set the burst period: Set the burst period (the interval at which internally-triggered bursts are generated) to any value from 1 μs to 8000 seconds using BURSt:INTernal:PERiod. Used only in the
triggered burst mode with an internal trigger source.
5. Set the burst starting phase: Set the starting phase of the burst from -360 to +360 degrees using
BURSt:PHASe.
6. Select the trigger source: Select the trigger source using the TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce command. Used
in the triggered burst mode only.
7. Enable the burst mode: After configuring the other burst parameters, enable burst mode
(BURSt:STATe ON).

Burst Modes
There are two burst modes, described below. The instrument enables one burst mode at a time.
l

Triggered Burst Mode (default): The instrument outputs a waveform for a number of cycles (burst
count) each time a trigger is received. After outputting the specified number of cycles, the instrument
stops and waits for the next trigger. You can configure the instrument to use an internal trigger to initiate the burst or you can provide an external trigger by pressing the front panel [Trigger] key, by
applying a trigger signal to the rear-panel Ext Trig connector, or by sending a software trigger command from the remote interface.

l

External Gated Burst Mode: The instrument output is either "on" or "off" based on the level of the
external signal applied to the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. When this signal is true, the instrument
outputs a continuous waveform. When this signal goes false, the current waveform cycle is completed and then the instrument stops while remaining at the voltage corresponding to the starting
burst phase of the waveform.

The following table shows which modes are associated with which burst features.

The difference between gated burst and gated output is that gated burst synchronously starts and stops
using full waveform cycles, where gated output asynchronously turns instrument output on or off with an
external trigger, independent of the waveform phase.
If the duty cycle is changed on a triggered bursted square wave with the trigger mode set to
Timer, the current burst will finish and one more burst will be executed before the duty cycle
of the burst changes.

[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:GATE:POLarity {NORMal|INVerted}
[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:GATE:POLarity?
Selects true-high (NORMal) or true-low (INVerted) logic levels on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector for an
externally gated burst.
Parameter

Typical Return

{NORMal|INVerted}, default NORMal

NORM or INV

Select true-low logic for an externally gated burst:

[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:INTernal:PERiod {<seconds>|MINimum|MAXimum}
[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:INTernal:PERiod? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the burst period for internally-triggered bursts.
Parameter
1 µs to 8000 s, default 10 ms

Typical Return
+1.200000000000000E+01

Sets the burst period to 12 seconds:
BURS:INT:PER 12
l

The burst period is the time between the starts of consecutive bursts.

l

This is used only when IMMediate triggering is enabled (TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce IMMediate). It is
ignored when manual or external triggering is enabled (or with gated burst mode).

l

On the 33500 Series, burst period must satisfy the following formula:
Burst Period ≥ (Burst Count / Waveform Frequency) + 1 μs.
On the 33600 Series, burst period must satisfy the following formula:
Burst Period ≥ (Burst Count / Waveform Frequency) + 500 ns, with a minimum Burst Period of 1 μs.

l

239

If the burst period is too short, the instrument will increase it as needed to continuously re-trigger the
burst. From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will also be generated.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:MODE {TRIGgered|GATed}
[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:MODE?
Selects the burst mode.
Parameter

Typical Return

{TRIGgered|GATed}, default TRIGgered

TRIG or GAT

Set gated burst mode
BURS:MODE GATED
l

TRIGgered: the instrument outputs a waveform for a number of cycles (burst count) each time a trigger is received from the trigger source (TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce).

l

In GATed burst mode, the output waveform is on or off, based on the signal at the rear-panel Ext Trig
connector. Select this signal's polarity using BURSt:GATE:POLarity. When the gate signal is true, the
instrument outputs a continuous waveform. When the gate signal goes false, the current waveform
cycle is completed and the instrument stops and remains at the voltage level corresponding to the
waveform's starting burst phase. For a noise waveform, the output stops immediately when the gate
signal goes false.

l

GATed: burst count, burst period, and trigger source are ignored (these are used for the triggered
burst mode only). If a manual trigger is received (TRIGger[1|2] ), it is ignored and no error will be generated.

[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:NCYCles {<num_cycles>|INFinity|MINimum|MAXimum}
[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:NCYCles? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the number of cycles to be output per burst (triggered burst mode only).
Parameter
Whole number from 1 (default) to 100,000,000, limited as described
below

Typical Return
+5.000000000000000E+01

Return number of cycles per burst:
BURS:NCYC 50
l

With TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce IMMediate, burst count must be less than the product of the maximum
burst period (8000 s) and the waveform frequency, as shown below.
Burst Count < (Maximum Burst Period)(Waveform Frequency)

l

The increase the burst period up to its maximum value to accommodate the burst count (but the
waveform frequency will not be changed). From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will
also be generated.

l

When gated burst mode is selected, the burst count is ignored. However, if you change the burst
count while in the gated mode, the instrument remembers the new count and used it when the
triggered mode is selected.

[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:PHASe {<angle>|MINimum|MAXimum}
[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:PHASe? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the starting phase angle for the burst.
Parameter

Typical Return

-360 to +360 degrees, -2π to +2π radians, or -(period) to +(period), as
specified by UNIT:ANGLe. Default 0.

+6.0000000000000E+01

Set starting burst phase to 60 degrees:
UNIT:ANGLE DEG
BURS:PHAS 60
l

Note that BURSt:PHASe is used instead of output phase, and when burst is enabled, the output phase
is set to 0.

l

For sine, square, and ramp, 0 degrees is the point at which the waveform crosses 0 V (or DC offset) in
a positive-going direction. For arbitrary waveforms, 0 degrees is the first waveform point. Start phase
has no effect on noise.

l

For arbitrary waveforms on the 33500 Series, BURSt:PHASe is only available if the waveform is
1,000,000 points or less.

l

Start phase also used in gated burst mode. When the gate signal goes false, the current waveform
cycle finishes, and output remains at the voltage level of the starting burst phase.

[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:STATe {ON|1|OFF|0}
[SOURce[1|2]:]BURSt:STATe?
Enables or disables burst mode.
Parameter

Typical Return

{ON|1|OFF|0}, default OFF

0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

Enable burst mode:
BURS:STAT ON
l

Output phase is set to 0 when burst is enabled.

l

To avoid multiple waveform changes, enable the burst mode after configuring the other burst parameters.

l

The instrument will not allow the burst mode to be enabled at the same time that sweep or any modulation mode is enabled. When you enable burst, the sweep or modulation mode is turned off.

[SOURce[1|2]:]COMBine:FEED {CH1|CH2|NONE}
[SOURce[1|2]:]COMBine:FEED?
Enables or disables the combining of both channels' outputs on a two-channel instrument into a single
channel connector. The "SOURce" keyword (default, SOURce1) specifies the base channel, and <source>
specifies the channel to be combined with the base channel.
Parameter
{CH1|CH2|NONE}, default NONE

Typical Return
CH1, CH2, or NONE

Set the COMBine:FEED source for base Channel 1 to be Channel 2:
COMB:FEED CH2
l

COMBine:FEED allows digital data from both channels to be added together to create the output signal on the output DAC for the base channel.

l

Only one channel may operate in COMBine:FEED mode at a time

l

Unlike the Modulation and SUM commands, COMBine:FEED can add two modulated signals.

l

COMBine:FEED can generate quadrature modulated signals from the two channels to be added
together into a single connector.

l

To use COMBine:FEED, first configure all parameters on the individual channels.

l

The signals to be combined may have a fixed phase offset between the channels.

l

You can use COMBine:FEED to add noise from a second channel to a modulated signal on the base
channel.

l

If COMBine:FEED would cause the combined output to exceed either the instrument's output rating
or the programmed limits, the instrument will set COMBine:FEED to NONE and report a settings conflict error.

l

Signals are combined in digital form. When two signals of significantly different amplitudes are combined, the lower amplitude signal may have reduced resolution proportional to the ratio of the two
amplitudes.

l

Changing the function amplitude or sum amplitude of the master or combined channel will not
change the amplitude or offset of any other function or channel. If changing the function amplitude or
sum amplitude of the master or combined channel would result in exceeding either the output rating
or the programmed limits, the amplitude value will be clipped and a settings conflict error will be
reported.

l

Changing the channel offset of the master or combined channel will not change the amplitude or offset of any other function or channel. If changing channel offset of the master or combined channel
would result in exceeding either the output rating or the programmed limits, the amplitude value will
be clipped and the instrument will report a settings conflict error.

l

If turning limits on or adjusting programmed limits would result in a limit being lower than a signal
maximum or higher than a signal minimum, the limits will not be turned on or adjusted, and the instrument will report a settings conflict error.

Examples
The following example uses DATA commands to set up an arbitrary waveform sequence.
The DATA:SEQuence command shown below is an example of a definite-length block. The
"#3" at the beginning indicates that the next three digits will indicate how many characters are in the block. The "164" immediately following indicates that there are 164 characters in the string that follows.
Note that the long DATA:SEQuence command splits across lines for readability purposes.
Note also that the quotation marks in the DATA:SEQuence command are optional.

This sequence runs the Haversine waveform 30 times and then runs the Cardiac and Gaussian waveforms
10 times each. The Haversine waveform forces the marker high at the start of each run and then sets it
low at the marker point. The other two waveforms maintain the marker setting.

Format for <arb_name>

Many DATA commands use the name of an arbitrary waveform. The following rules apply:
<arb_name> must match:

l

l

A waveform already loaded into waveform memory

l

A waveform existing in INTERNAL or USB mass memory

See MMEMory:LOAD:DATA[1|2], DATA:ARBitrary, or DATA:ARBitrary:DAC for valid formats for <arb_
name>.

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]DATA:ARBitrary2:FORMat {AABB|ABAB}

(Applies only to instruments with the optional IQ player capability.)
Specifies whether the format for data points in DATA:ARB2 and DATA:ARB2:DAC commands is interleaved (ABAB) or all of channel 1 followed by all of channel 2 (AABB).
You may spell out the keyword ARBitrary2, but you must abbreviate it as ARB2. You
cannot abbreviate it as ARB.

Parameter
{AABB|ABAB}

Typical Return
AABB or ABAB

Specify an interleaved data format for dual arbitrary waveform data:
DATA:ARB2:FORM ABAB
l

The SOURce keyword is ignored for this command.

l

If you wish to have a 3 DAC count signal on channel 1 and a 4 DAC count signal on channel 2, the
AABB format would dictate that the data must be sent as 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4. The
ABAB format would dictate the order 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4.

block of data. The DAC codes go from -32,768 to +32,767 on both the 33500 Series and 33600 Series.

The optional [1|2] after the ARBitrary keyword indicates whether the data to be downloaded contains one (default) or two channels of data.
To use dual arbitrary waveform files (single files containing two channels of arbitrary
waveform data), you must have the optional IQ Player.)

Parameter
<arb_name> An unquoted string of up to 12 characters.

Typical Return
(none)

<binary_block> integer values from -32767 to +32767 or
floating point values from -1.0 to +1.0 in Definite Length Arbitrary Block format (details below). From 8 to 1M or 16M
samples per waveform, depending on the model and options.
Definite-length block data allows any type of device-dependent data to be transmitted as a series of 8-bit binary data
bytes. This is particularly useful for transferring large quantities of data or 8-bit extended ASCII codes.

l

Each data point is either a 16-bit integer from -32,767 and +32,767 or a 32-bit floating point value
from -1.0 to +1.0. Therefore, the total number of bytes is always two times or four times the number
of data points in the waveform. For example, 16,000 bytes are required to download a waveform with
8,000 points as integers, but 32,000 bytes are required to download the same waveform as floating
point values.

l

The values -32767 and +32767 or -1.0 to +1.0 correspond to the peak values of the waveform (if the
offset is 0 V). For example, if you set the output amplitude to 10 Vpp, +32767 corresponds to +5 V and
-32767 corresponds to -5 V.

l

Use FORMat:BORDer to select the byte order for block mode binary transfers.

l

Use DATA:ARB2:FORMat to specify whether dual arbitrary waveforms are interleaved or sequential
(channel 1 followed by channel 2).

l

Specifying a waveform that is already loaded generates a "Specified arb waveform already exists"
error. Deleting an existing waveform requires clearing all of the waveform memory with DATA:VOLatile:CLEar.

l

The total available sample size for all waveforms loaded per channel is either 1 MSa or 16 MSa
(33500 Series) or 4 MSa or 64 MSa (33600 Series), depending on model and options. A new waveform
may be limited by waveforms already loaded.
Regardless of what options may be installed, the maximum waveform size for the embedded
waveform editor is 1 MSa.

Arbitrary Waveform Limitations: For arbitrary waveforms, amplitude is limited if the waveform data
points do not span the full range of the output DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). For example, the
built-in "Sinc" waveform does not use the full range of values, so its maximum amplitude is limited to
6.087 Vpp (into 50 Ω).

Parameter
IEEE Definite Length Arbitrary Block, described below.

Typical Return

l

Even arbitrary waveforms with millions of points may be insufficient for applications requiring special
sequencing or the repetition of waveforms dependent upon time or external events. Sequencing arbitrary waveforms allows you to arrange and conditionally repeat waveforms. This allows you to use less
memory and to achieve greater application flexibility.

Definite-length block data allows any type of device-dependent data to be transmitted as a series of 8bit binary data bytes. This is particularly useful for transferring large quantities of data or 8-bit extended
ASCII codes.
l

<block_descriptor> is of the format #<n><n digits><sequence name>,<arb name1>,<repeat count1>,<play control1>,<marker mode1>, <marker point1>, <arb name2>,<repeat count2>,<play control2>,<marker mode2>, <marker point2>, and so on, where:
l

<n>specifies the number of digits used to indicate the size of the block.

l

<n digits> is one or more digits hat specifies the number of data bytes to come.

l

<sequence name> is an optionally quoted string that specifies the name of sequence that contains
the arbitrary waveforms specified in the following parameters.

l

<arb name> is an optionally quoted string that specifies the name of the arbitrary waveform that
was loaded with the MMEM:LOAD:DATA[1|2] or DATA:ARBitrary commands.

l

<repeat count> is an optionally quoted string that specifies the number of times to repeat the
waveform. This value can range from 1 to 1E6 or infinite. This will only be recognized in the hardware if Play Control is set to "repeat".

l

<play control> is an optionally quoted string that specifies how the arbitrary waveform is to be
played in the sequence:
l

once- play once

l

onceWaitTrig- play once and then wait for trigger. Triggers will not be accepted until the play
of the specified segment has completed.

l

repeat- repeat number of times specified by repeat count

l

repeatInf- repeat until stopped (infinite)

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

254

l

repeatTilTrig - repeat until triggered then advance
With small waveforms, it may take a few cycles after the trigger is received to
switch to the next waveform. This is because the samples in the sample buffer
must be cleared.

l

l

l

<marker mode> is an optionally quoted string that specifies how the marker behaves in the arbitrary waveform:
l

maintain- maintain current marker state at start of segment

l

lowAtStart- force marker low at start of segment

l

highAtStart- force marker high at start of segment

l

highAtStartGoLow- force marker high at start of segment and then low at marker position

<marker point> a number specifying the marker location in the arbitrary waveform. This value
must be between 4 and the number of points in the arbitrary waveform minus 3.

If you specify an arbitrary waveform that has not been loaded, a "Specified arb waveform does not
exist" error is generated.

Example of DATA:SEQuence command

The following command constructs a sequence (named mySequence) of three segments (A.arb, B.arb,
and C.arb) that were previously loaded from the USB drive using MMEMory:LOAD:DATA[1|2]. The
sequence plays A once, and B five times. It then plays C repeatedly while waiting for a trigger to advance,
and finally ends with A. Each segment has the <marker point> set to 10.
The command is shown on multiple lines for readability purposes only.
DATA:SEQ #3158"mySequence","USB:\A.arb",0,once,lowAtStart,10,"USB:\B.arb",5,repeat,highAtStart,10,
"USB:\C.arb",0,repeatTilTrig,maintain,10,"USB:\A.arb",0,once,lowAtStart,10
Many text editors let you count the number of bytes in the block simply by highlighting a text string. In
this example, the size is 158, which requires 3 digits to represent – hence the #3158 header.
Using this approach requires you to pre-load all of the arbitrary waveforms and set the amplitude and offset (or high and low levels), sample rate, and filter. See MMEM:LOAD:DATA to combine all that information into a single file rather than creating a block transfer with multiple SCPI commands.

memory consumes space allocated in 128-point blocks, so a waveform of 8 to 128 points consumes one
such block, a waveform of 129 to 256 points consumes two blocks, and so on.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FM[:DEViation] {<peak_deviation_in_Hz>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FM[:DEViation]? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the peak frequency deviation in Hz. This value represents the peak variation in frequency of the modulated waveform from the carrier frequency.
Parameter

Typical Return

1 μHz to 15.05 (limited to 150 kHz for RAMP); default 100 Hz

+1.000000000000000E+03

Set peak frequency deviation to 1 kHz:
FM:DEV 1000
Set peak frequency deviation to 1 μHz:
FM:DEV MIN
l

The deviation cannot exceed the carrier frequency. If you attempt to set a deviation that exceeds the
carrier frequency (with FM enabled), the instrument will adjust the deviation to the maximum value
allowed for that carrier frequency. From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will also be
generated.

l

The carrier frequency plus the deviation cannot exceed the selected function's maximum frequency
plus 100 kHz. If you attempt to set the deviation to an invalid value, the instrument adjusts it to the
maximum value allowed with the present carrier frequency. The remote interface also generates a
"Data out of range" error.

l

If the deviation causes the carrier waveform to exceed a frequency boundary for the current duty
cycle (square waveform only), the instrument will adjust the duty cycle to the maximum value
allowed with the present carrier frequency. From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will
also be generated.

l

If you select the External modulating source, the deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal level
(optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if the
frequency deviation is 100 kHz, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the 33600 Series) corresponds to a 100 kHz increase in frequency. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation and
negative signal levels reduce the frequency below the carrier frequency.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FM:INTernal:FREQuency {<frequency>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FM:INTernal:FREQuency? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the frequency of the modulating waveform. The modulating source waveform operates at that frequency, within the frequency limits of that waveform.
Parameter

Typical Return

1 μHz to the maximum allowed for the internal function. Default 10 Hz

+1.000000000000000E+04

Set the modulating frequency to 10 kHz:
FM:INT:FREQ 10000
l

When you select an arbitrary waveform as the modulating source, the frequency changes to the frequency of the arbitrary waveform, which is based on the sample rate and the number of points in the
arbitrary waveform.

l

When using an arbitrary waveform for the modulating source, changing this parameter also changes
the cached metadata representing the arbitrary waveform's sample rate. You can also change the
modulating frequency of an arbitrary waveform with FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FREQuency, FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PERiod, and FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe. These commands and the modulation frequency command are directly coupled in order to keep the arbitrary waveform behaving exactly as it
was last played. If you later turn modulation off and select that same arbitrary waveform as the current function, its sample rate (and corresponding frequency based upon the number of points) will be
the same as it was when played as the modulation source.

l

If the internal function is TRIangle, UpRamp, or DnRamp, the maximum frequency is limited to 200
kHz on the 33500 Series or 800 kHz on the 33600 Series. If the internal function is PRBS, the frequency refers to bit rate and is limited as shown here.

l

This command should be used only with the internal modulation source (FM:SOURce INTernal).

[SOURce[1|2]:]FM:INTernal:FUNCtion <function>
[SOURce[1|2]:]FM:INTernal:FUNCtion?
This command selects the shape of the modulating waveform.

Typical Return
SIN, SQU, RAMP, NRAM, TRI, NOIS,
PRBS, or ARB

View internal function waveforms.
Select a sine wave as the modulating waveform.
FM:INT:FUNC SIN
l

This command should be used only with the internal modulation source (FM:SOURce INTernal).

l

Some combinations of carrier and internal function are not allowed: PRBS carrier and PRBS internal
function, ARB carrier and ARB internal function.

If you select EXTernal, the carrier waveform is modulated with an external waveform. Specifically:
l

AM: The modulation depth is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (or the optional ±1 V signal level
on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if modulation depth
(AM[:DEPTh]) is 100%, then when the modulating signal is at +5 V (or optionally +1 V on the 33600
Series), the output will be at the maximum amplitude. Similarly, a -5 V modulating signal (or
optionally -1 V on the 33600 Series) produces output at minimum amplitude.

l

FM: If you select the External modulating source, the deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal
level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For
example, if the frequency deviation is 100 kHz, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a 100 kHz increase in frequency. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation and negative signal levels reduce the frequency below the carrier frequency.

l

PM: With the External modulating source, deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you
have set the frequency deviation to 180 degrees, then a +5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a +180 degree phase deviation. Lower external signal levels produce
less deviation, and negative signal levels produce negative deviation.

l

Pulse as Selected Function: The pulse width or pulse duty cycle deviation is controlled by the ±5 V
signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) present on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you have set the pulse width deviation to 50 μs using the PWM:DEViation
command, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the 33600 Series) corresponds to a 50 μs
width increase. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation.

l

With EXTernal source, the output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSK) is determined by the signal level
on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. When a logic low is present, the carrier phase or carrier frequency is output. When a logic high is present, the phase shifted phase or hop frequency is output.

l

The maximum external BPSK rate is 1 MHz, and the maximum FSK rate is 1 MHz.

l

Note: the connector used for externally-controlled BPSK or FSK waveforms (Trig In) is not the same
connector that is used for externally-modulated AM, FM, PM, and PWM waveforms (Modulation In).
When used for BPSK or FSK, the Trig In connector does not have adjustable edge polarity and is not
affected by the TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe command.

l

With INTernal source, the rate at which output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSKey) "shifts" between
the carrier phase or frequency and the alternate phase or frequency is determined by the BPSK rate
(BPSK:INTernal:RATE) or FSK rate (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).

l

A channel may not be its own modulation source.

FREQuency Subsystem
The FREQuency subsystem sets the instrument's output frequency. In two-channel instruments, the
channels' frequencies may be coupled in various ways.
FREQuency:COUPle[:STATe] {ON|OFF|ONCE} enables or disables coupling, or using the ONCE, one channel's is copied to the other, but not coupled to it.
FREQuency:COUPle:MODE {OFFSet|RATio} specifies the frequency coupling mode.
FREQuency:MODE allows you to specify a frequency mode to use, including a sweep, frequency list, or
fixed frequency.

268

Example
The remaining FREQuency commands are used to generate a sweep, as summarized below:
1. Select the waveform shape, amplitude and offset: Use APPLy or the equivalent FUNCtion,
FREQuency, VOLTage, and VOLTage:OFFSet commands to select the function, frequency, amplitude,
and offset. You can select any non-arbitrary waveform.
2. Set frequency boundaries of the sweep: FREQuency:STARt and FREQuency:STOP, or
FREQuency:CENTer and FREQuency:SPAN.
3. Select sweep mode (linear or logarithmic): SWEep:SPACing
4. Set sweep time in seconds: SWEep:TIME
5. Select sweep trigger source: TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce
6. Set frequency at which signal on front panel Sync connector goes low during sweep (optional):
MARKer:FREQuency
[SOURce[1|2]:]FREQuency {<frequency>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FREQuency? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the output frequency. This command is paired with FUNCtion:PULSe:PERiod; whichever one is
executed last overrides the other.

Function Limitations: The frequency limits are function dependent, as shown in the above table. If you
send a command specifying a frequency that is not in the appropriate range for the current function,
an error will occur. For example, if the current function is "ramp" and you send the command FREQ 20
MHZ, a "Data out of range" error is generated and the frequency is set to 200 kHz (33500 Series) or
800 kHz (33600 Series), which is the maximum for a ramp waveform.

Set sweep center frequency to 1 kHz:
FREQ:CENT 1000
l

The following equation shows how center frequency is limited by span frequency.
Center Frequency (max) = Max. Frequency for waveform - (Span/2)

l

The following equation shows how center frequency relates to start and stop frequencies.
Center Frequency = |(Stop Frequency - Start Frequency)|/2

[SOURce[1|2]:]FREQuency:COUPle[:STATe] {ON|1|OFF|0}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FREQuency:COUPle[:STATe]?
Enables/disables frequency coupling between channels in a two-channel instrument.
Parameter
{ON|1|OFF|0}, default OFF

Typical Return
0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

Turn on the frequency couple state:
FREQ:COUP ON
l

Specifying ON starts frequency coupling as specified by FREQuency:COUPle:MODE.

l

If the current offset or ratio, combined with the current frequency settings, would cause either frequency to exceed instrument specifications, the instrument will generate an error and the exceeded
frequency will clip at its maximum or minimum value.

l

If setting mode to RATIO and setting RATIO to 1.0 still exceeds the specifications of either channel
(for example, channel 1 is a 3 MHz sine and channel 2 is a ramp, which cannot go that high), an error
message will be generated and FREQuency:COUPle will be turned OFF.

SOUR2:FREQ:COUP:OFFS 350 KHZ
Set frequency of channel 1 to 455 kHz below frequency of channel 2:
SOUR2:FREQ:COUP:OFFS -455 KHZ
l

The SOURce channel (SOURce1 or SOURce2) is used as the reference channel and the OFFSet is applied
to the other channel. For example, suppose the instrument is in FREQ:COUPLE:STATE ON and in
FREQ:COUPLE:MODE OFFSET (frequency offset mode active), and channel 1 is currently operating at 1.0
MHz. The command SOURce1:FREQuency:COUPle:OFFSet 500 will cause channel 1 to remain at 1.0
MHz, and channel 2 to be set to 1.5 MHz. As the frequency of either channel is changed, the frequency of
the other channel will change to maintain the 500 kHz offset.
l

If the frequency coupling would cause either channel to exceed instrument frequency specifications
for the present functions, the command will result in an error, and the frequency will be set to its maximum or minimum limit for that channel.

l

Frequency coupling is not valid with arbitrary waveforms, but you can couple the sample rate of arbitrary waveforms.

l

The SOURce channel (SOURce1 or SOURce2) is used as the reference channel and the RATIO is
applied to the other channel. For example, suppose the instrument is in FREQuency:COUPle ON and
FREQuency:COUPle:MODE RATio. Furthermore, suppose channel 1 is currently operating at 2 kHz,
and channel 2 is at 10 kHz. The command SOURce1:FREQuency:COUPle:RATio 2.5 will cause channel
1 to remain at 2 kHz, and Channel 2 to be set to 5 kHz. As the frequency of either channel is changed,
the frequency of the other channel will change to maintain the 2.5 ratio.

l

If the frequency coupling would cause either channel to exceed instrument frequency specifications
for the present functions, the command will result in an error, and the frequency will be set to its maximum or minimum limit for that channel.

l

If you select EXTernal, the carrier waveform is modulated with an external waveform. Specifically:
l

AM: The modulation depth is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (or the optional ±1 V signal level
on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if modulation depth
(AM[:DEPTh]) is 100%, then when the modulating signal is at +5 V (or optionally +1 V on the 33600
Series), the output will be at the maximum amplitude. Similarly, a -5 V modulating signal (or
optionally -1 V on the 33600 Series) produces output at minimum amplitude.

l

FM: If you select the External modulating source, the deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal
level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For
example, if the frequency deviation is 100 kHz, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a 100 kHz increase in frequency. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation and negative signal levels reduce the frequency below the carrier frequency.

l

PM: With the External modulating source, deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you
have set the frequency deviation to 180 degrees, then a +5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a +180 degree phase deviation. Lower external signal levels produce
less deviation, and negative signal levels produce negative deviation.

l

Pulse as Selected Function: The pulse width or pulse duty cycle deviation is controlled by the ±5 V
signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) present on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you have set the pulse width deviation to 50 μs using the PWM:DEViation
command, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the 33600 Series) corresponds to a 50 μs
width increase. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation.

l

With EXTernal source, the output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSK) is determined by the signal level
on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. When a logic low is present, the carrier phase or carrier frequency is output. When a logic high is present, the phase shifted phase or hop frequency is output.

l

The maximum external BPSK rate is 1 MHz, and the maximum FSK rate is 1 MHz.

l

Note: the connector used for externally-controlled BPSK or FSK waveforms (Trig In) is not the same
connector that is used for externally-modulated AM, FM, PM, and PWM waveforms (Modulation In).
When used for BPSK or FSK, the Trig In connector does not have adjustable edge polarity and is not
affected by the TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe command.

l

With INTernal source, the rate at which output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSKey) "shifts" between
the carrier phase or frequency and the alternate phase or frequency is determined by the BPSK rate
(BPSK:INTernal:RATE) or FSK rate (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).

l

A channel may not be its own modulation source.

The selected waveform (other than an arbitrary waveform) is output using the previously selected frequency, amplitude, and offset voltage settings. Arbitrary waveforms are played according to the settings specified in the arbitrary waveform file. Brand new arbitrary waveforms inherit the current
arbitrary waveform settings.

l

NOISe generates white gaussian noise with adjustable bandwidth and crest factor about 3.5.

l

PRBS generates pseudo-random noise using Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) user selectable
methods.

l

ARB generates the arbitrary waveform currently selected by FUNCtion:ARBitrary.

l

Function Limitations: If you change to a function whose maximum frequency is less than that of the
current function, the frequency is adjusted to the maximum for the new function. For example, if you
change a high frequency sine wave to the ramp function, the instrument will adjust the output frequency to 200 kHz (the upper limit for ramps)From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error
will also be generated.

l

Amplitude Limitations: If you change to a function whose maximum amplitude is less than that of the
current function, the amplitude is adjusted to the maximum for the new function. This may occur
when the output units are Vrms or dBm due to the differences in crest factor for the various output
functions For example, if you change a 5 Vrms square wave (into 50 Ω) to a sine wave, the instrument
will adjust the amplitude to 3.536 Vrms (the upper limit for sine in Vrms). The remote interface will
also generate a "Settings conflict" error.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:ARBitrary {<filename>}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:ARBitrary?
Selects an arbitrary waveform (.arb/.barb) or sequence (.seq) that has previously been loaded into volatile
memory for the channel specified with MMEMory:LOAD:DATA[1|2] or DATA:ARBitrary. Several waveforms
can be in volatile memory simultaneously.
Parameter
See MMEMory:LOAD:DATA[1|2], for valid <filename>
formats.

Typical Return
"INT:\MyArb103.arb"

Select an arbitrary waveform in memory on channel 2:
FUNC:ARB "INT:\MyArb103.arb"
Load an arbitrary waveform from the internal drive into volatile memory. Then select and play the waveform:
MMEM:LOAD:DATA "INT:\BUILTIN\Sinc.arb"
FUNCtion:ARBitrary "INT:\BUILTIN\Sinc.arb"
FUNCtion ARB
l

The <filename> should match the filename used to load the arbitrary waveform or sequence into volatile memory with MMEMory:LOAD:DATA[1|2], DATA:ARBitrary, DATA:ARBitrary:DAC, or
DATA:SEQuence.

l

When you store an arbitrary waveform segment or sequence (MMEMory:STORe:DATA[1|2]), the instrument's current settings (voltage values, sample rate, filter type, and so on) are stored in the segment
or sequence file. When you play the file for the first time with FUNCtion:ARBitrary, these settings are
loaded and override the instrument's current settings. If you have manually edited a segment or
sequence file such that the instrument settings have been removed, the instrument settings will not
be changed when you execute FUNCtion:ARBitrary.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:ARBitrary:ADVance {TRIGger|SRATe}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:ARBitrary:ADVance?
Specifies the method for advancing to the next arbitrary waveform data point for the specified channel.
Parameter
{TRIGger|SRATe}, default TRIG

Typical Return
TRIG or SRAT

Set advance method to trigger:
FUNC:ARB:ADV TRIG
l

TRIGger causes instrument to advance to next data point with each trigger received and forces
TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce to EXTernal.

l

SRATe causes instrument to advance to next data point at the sample rate set by FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer {NORMal|STEP|OFF}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer?
Specifies the filter setting for an arbitrary waveform.
Parameter
{NORMal|STEP|OFF}, default STEP

Typical Return
NORMal, STEP, or OFF

Set filter to NORMal:
FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer NORM
l

NORMal filters the data points with the filter that provides the flattest frequency response. This effectively smoothes the signal, but sharp transitions will have preshoot and overshoot.

l

STEP filters the data points in a way that effectively smoothes the signal while minimizing the
preshoot and overshoot. However, this setting has a narrower bandwidth than the NORMal setting.

l

OFF steps from point to point at the sample rate. Moves between data points are accomplished as
quickly as possible with no smoothing. If the <mode> is set to OFF, the instrument uses a filter whose
bandwidth limit restricts the maximum sample rate for the arbitrary waveform to 62.5 MSa/s (33500
Series) or 250 MSa/s (33600 Series).

l

To use this command on the 33600 Series, you must set FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer to OFF.

Parameter

Typical Return

<frequency> (Hz): Limited by the number of waveform points; default
based on 40 kSa/s sample rate.

+1.000000000000000E+03

<period> (seconds): Limited by the number of waveform points;
default based on 40 kSa/s sample rate.

+1.000000000000000E-03

Set arbitrary waveform frequency to 1000 Hz.
FUNC:ARB:FREQ 1000
l

With FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer OFF, the arbitrary waveform sample rate is limited to 1/4 of the maximum sample rate.

l

The <frequency> ranges from 1 µHz to 31.25 MHz on the 33500 Series or 250 MHz on the 33600 Series. Frequency is also limited by the Filter setting. With FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer OFF, the arbitrary
waveform sample rate is limited to 62.5 MSa/s. Therefore, frequency is also reduced to 7.8125 MHz
for an eight point waveform (33500 Series) or one-quarter of that for a 32-point waveform (33600 Series).

l

The arbitrary waveform sample rate and frequency are not coupled to SOUR:FREQ, which applies to
only non-arbitrary waveforms.

l

The arbitrary waveform plays at a speed specified by the sample rate. When setting the frequency or
period of an arbitrary waveform, the instrument changes the sample rate based on the number of
points in the waveform and the new frequency or period setting. The new frequency or period may be
altered slightly to meet the restrictions of Sample Rate resolution and the number of points. In other
words, frequency will be recalculated from the new sample rate and number of points to ensure compatibility between the coupled parameters. This is due to math resolution of 15 digits in combination
with a sample rate that can also be 15 digits.

l

Changing the number of points in the waveform, or changing the sample rate with FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe, changes the frequency and period settings.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PTPeak {<voltage>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}

Sets peak to peak voltage.
Parameter
10 VDC into 50 Ω, 20 VDC into an open circuit; default 100 mV

Typical Return
+4.000000000000000E+00

Set peak to peak voltage to 4 V:
FUNC:ARBitrary:PTPeak 4
l

Limits Due to Amplitude: You can set the voltage levels to a positive or negative value with the restrictions shown below. Vpp is the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude for the selected output termination
(10 Vpp into 50 Ω or 20 Vpp into an open circuit).
Vhigh – Vlow≤ Vpp (max) and Vhigh, Vlow≤ Vpp (max)/2

l

Differences between remote and front panel operation:
l

Remote Interface: Setting the high or low level from the remote interface can change the high
level or low level to achieve the desired setting. In this case either a "Data out of range" or "Settings conflict" error will occur. If the high level is set below the low level, the instrument will set
the low level 1 mV less than the high level. If the high level is set below the LOW limit or the instrument output specifications, the low level will be set to the LOW limit or instrument output specification and the high level will be set 1 mV above the low level. A similar set of rules applies if the
low level is set incorrectly.

l

Similarly, the low level can be set above the high level from the remote interface. In this case the
instrument will set the high level 1 mV larger than the low level. If the low level is set higher than
the HIGH limit or the instrument output specifications, the high level will be set to the HIGH limit
or instrument output specification and the low level will be set 1 mV below the high level.

l

Front Panel: Setting the high or low level from the front panel may clip that level setting in order
to achieve the desired level setting, and a "Data out of range" error will be generated. The high
level cannot be set below the low level from the front panel.

l

Setting the high and low levels also sets the waveform amplitude and offset. For example, if you set
the high level to +2 V and the low level to -3 V, the resulting amplitude is 5 Vpp, with a -500 mV offset.

l

Limits Due to Output Termination: If you change the output termination setting, the displayed voltage
levels will be adjusted (and no error will be generated). For example, if you set the high level to +100
mVDC and then change the output termination from 50 Ω to "high impedance", the amplitude displayed on the front panel will double to +200 mVDC. If you change from "high impedance" to 50 Ω,
the displayed amplitude will be halved. Changing the output termination setting does not change the
voltage present at the output terminals of the instrument. This only changes the displayed values on
the front panel and the values queried from the remote interface. The voltage present at the instrument's output depends on the load connected to the instrument. See OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD for details.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

286

l

Limits due to voltage limits: If the voltage limits are enabled, the level settings are checked against
the specified limits (VOLTage:LIMit:HIGH, VOLTage:LIMit:LOW) before a change in level is executed. If
a change in output level would exceed a LIMIT setting, the level is clipped to the maximum (or minimum) value allowed that will not exceed the LIMit setting and a "Settings conflict" error will be
generated.

l

Limits due to Output Coupling: If two channels are coupled, limitations of setting the levels of both
channels will be checked before a change in level is executed. In this case, if a change in level would
exceed a LIMIT setting, or instrument output specifications for either channel, the level is clipped to
the maximum (or minimum) allowable value and a "Settings conflict" error will be generated.

l

To invert the waveform relative to the offset voltage, use OUTPut[1|2]:POLarity.

Sets the sample rate for the arbitrary waveform.
Parameter

Typical Return

1 µSa/s to 250 MSa/s (33500 Series) or 1 GSa/s (33600 Series), default
40 kSa/s. Limited to 62.5 MSa/s (33500 Series) or 250 MSa/s (33600
Series) if FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer is OFF.

+1.000000000000000E+04

Set sample rate to 10 kSa/s:
FUNC:ARB:SRAT 1e4
l

The sample rate and frequency parameter are not coupled when playing an arbitrary waveform segment. The concept of frequency does not apply for arbitrary waveform sequences.

l

Setting a sample rate when not in the ARB mode will not change the frequency. For example, if the
current function is sine, setting sample rate has no effect until the function changes to ARB.

l

The maximum sample rate depends on the filter applied to the arbitrary waveform. See FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer for details.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SYNChronize
Causes two independent arbitrary waveforms to synchronize to first point of each waveform (two-channel instruments only).
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
(none)

Load an internal Haversine waveform into channel 1 and a custom waveform from a USB drive into channel 2. Set both sample rates to 100 kSa/s and then synchronize both channels to the first point of each
waveform:
MMEM:LOAD:DATA "Int:\Builtin\HAVERSINE.arb"
FUNC:ARB "Int:\Builtin\HAVERSINE.ARB"
FUNC ARB
FUNC:ARB:SRATE 1E+05

SOUR2:FUNC:ARB "USB:\MyFiles\TestDUT3.arb"
SOUR2:FUNC ARB
SOUR2:FUNC:ARB:SRAT 1E+05
FUNC:ARB:SYNC
l

This command stops and restarts the arbitrary waveforms on both channels at whatever sample rates
they happen to be set.

l

If the two arbitrary waveforms have the same number of points and sample rate, they will remain synchronized over multiple repetitions; otherwise, they will only be synchronized at the beginning and
after numbers of repetitions that happen to be multiples of the number of points in both waveforms.
For example, if you synchronize an 8-point waveform and a 10-point waveform, they will re-synchronize after 40, 80, and 120 repetitions.

l

This functionality is similar to using burst mode, but it operates in continuous wave mode.

l

This command also works with burst, sweep, and modulation, when trying to synchronize two arbitrary waveforms.

l

A PRBS waveform using polynomial PNx is generated by a shift register of x bits, and the output waveform begins with x sample periods of high output. Sample period is the reciprocal of the sample rate
(FUNCtion:PRBS:BRATe), and the channel's Sync pulse indicates the waveform's start. For example, if
the PRBS uses PN23 with sample rate 500 Hz, the output begins with 46 ms of high output (23 x 2
ms).

Sets pulse duty cycle.
Parameter
0 to 100, limited as described below; default 10

Typical Return
+5.000000000000000E+01

Set duty cycle to 50%:
FUNC:PULS:DCYC 50
l

The FUNCtion:PULSe:DCYCle and FUNCtion:PULSe:WIDTh commands affect the same parameter. In
some applications, it is natural to adjust pulse width directly (in seconds); in others, adjusting duty
cycle seems more natural. When frequency is adjusted, if pulse width was most recently adjusted as
duty cycle on the front panel, then duty cycle will be kept constant as frequency or period changes.
However, if pulse width was the last setting, then pulse width will be kept constant as frequency or
period changes. See FUNCtion:PULSe:HOLD.

l

The pulse duty cycle is defined as:
Duty Cycle = 100 x Pulse Width ÷ Period
Pulse width is the time from the 50% threshold of a pulse's rising edge to the 50% threshold of the
next falling edge.

l

The pulse duty cycle range is 0 percent to 100 percent. However, the pulse duty cycle is limited by
minimum pulse width and edge time restrictions, which prevent you from setting exactly 0 percent or
100 percent. For example, for a 1 kHz pulse waveform, you are typically restricted to pulse duty
cycles in the range 0.002 percent to 99.998 percent. This is limited by the minimum pulse width of 16
ns on the 33500 Series or 5 ns up to 4 Vpp and 8 ns up to 10 Vpp on the 33600 Series.

l

Restrictions Based on Pulse Width: The specified pulse duty cycle must conform to the following
restrictions determined by the minimum pulse width. The instrument will adjust pulse duty cycle as
needed to accommodate the specified period. From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error
will also be generated.
Duty Cycle ≥ 100(Minimum Pulse Width/ Period)
and
Duty Cycle ≤ 100 (1 – Minimum Pulse Width/ Period)
On the 33500 Series, the minimum pulse width is 16 ns. On the 33600 Series, the minimum pulse
width is 5 ns up to 4 Vpp and 8 ns up to 10 Vpp.

l

Restrictions Based On and Affecting Edge Time: The specified pulse duty cycle may affect the edge
time. The edge time is adjusted first, and then the duty cycle is adjusted to accommodate the specified period, conforming to the following restriction. From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict"
error will also be generated.
Duty Cycle ≥ [(0.8 x Leading Edge Time) + (0.8 x Trailing Edge Time) ]/ Period x 100

Sets the pulse waveform parameter (either pulse width or duty cycle) to be held constant as other parameters are varied.
Parameter
{WIDTh|DCYCle}, default WIDTh

Typical Return
WIDT or DCYC

Set the instrument to hold duty cycle for pulse waveforms:
FUNC:PULS:HOLD DCYC
l

WIDTh: the instrument holds the pulse width setting (in seconds) constant as the period is varied. If a
command to set a duty cycle value is received, the duty cycle is converted to the equivalent pulse
width. If pulse width modulation (PWM) is turned on, the pulse width and width deviation are held as
the period is varied. Duty cycle deviation commands are converted to width deviations.
Minimum width and edge time restrictions apply. May cause a change in the selected edge times,
pulse width, or both.

l

DCYCle: the instrument holds the pulse duty cycle setting (in percent) constant as the period is varied. If a command to set a pulse width value is received, the width is converted to the equivalent duty
cycle. If pulse width modulation (PWM) is turned on, the pulse duty cycle and the duty cycle deviation
are held as the period is varied. Width deviation commands are converted to duty cycle deviation values.
Minimum width and edge time restrictions apply. May cause a change in the selected edge times,
duty cycle, or both.
The FUNCtion:PULSe:HOLD command does not limit period settings. The pulse width
or duty cycle may be adjusted if necessary to accommodate a new period setting.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:PULSe:PERiod? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the period for pulse waveforms. This command is paired with the FREQuency command; the one
executed last overrides the other, as frequency and period specify the same parameter.
Parameter

Typical Return

From reciprocal of instrument's maximum frequency up to 1,000,000 s.

Default 1 ms
Set the period to 500 ms:
FUNC:PULS:PER .5
or
FUNC:PULS:PER 500 ms
l

The specified period must be greater than the sum of the pulse width and the edge time. The instrument will adjust edge time and pulse width as needed to accommodate the specified period. From
the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will also be generated. The edge time is minimized
first, and then the width (or duty cycle) is adjusted as shown below.
Period ≥ [Pulse Width + ((Lead Edge Time + Trail Edge Time) * 0.625)]

l

This command affects the period (and frequency) for all waveform functions (not just pulse). For
example, if you select a period using FUNCtion:PULSe:PERiod and then change the output function to
sine wave, the specified period will be used for the new function.

l

Function Limitations: If you change to a function whose minimum period exceeds the value set by this
command, the period is adjusted to the new function's minimum pulse. For example, if you set a
period of 2 µs and then change to the ramp function, the instrument adjusts the period to 5 µs (the
minimum for ramps). From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will also be generated.

33600 Series: 2.9 ns up to 4 Vpp, and 3.3 ns above 4 Vpp, to 1 μsec; limited as described below
Set leading edge time to 10 ns (two methods):
FUNC:PULS:TRAN:LEADing 10 ns
FUNC:PULS:TRAN:LEADing .000000010
l

The leading edge time applies to rising edge, and represents the time from the 10% threshold to the
90% threshold of the edge; the trailing edge represents the time from the 90% threshold to the 10%
threshold.

l

The specified edge time must fit within the specified pulse width and period. The instrument will limit
the edge time to accommodate the specified pulse width or duty cycle. From the remote interface, a
"Settings conflict" error will also be generated.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:PULSe:WIDTh {<seconds>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:PULSe:WIDTh? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets pulse width.
Parameter

Typical Return

16 ns (33500 Series), 5 ns (33600 Series up to 4 Vpp), or 8 ns (33600
Series up to 10 Vpp) up to approximately 1,000,000 s, limited as
described below; default 100 µs

+5.000000000000000E-03

Set pulse width to 5 ms (two methods):
FUNC:PULS:WIDT 5 ms
FUNC:PULS:WIDT .005
l

The FUNCtion:PULSe:DCYCle and FUNCtion:PULSe:WIDTh commands affect the same parameter. In
some applications, it is natural to adjust pulse width directly (in seconds); in others, adjusting duty
cycle seems more natural. When frequency is adjusted, if pulse width was most recently adjusted as
duty cycle on the front panel, then duty cycle will be kept constant as frequency or period changes.
However, if pulse width was the last setting, then pulse width will be kept constant as frequency or
period changes. See FUNCtion:PULSe:HOLD.

l

Pulse width is the time from the 50% threshold of a pulse's rising edge to the 50% threshold of the
next falling edge.

l

The specified pulse width must be less than the difference between the period and the minimum
pulse width as shown below. The instrument will adjust pulse edge time first and then limit pulse
width as needed to accommodate the period. From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error
will also be generated.
Pulse Width ≤ Period – Wmin

l

The specified pulse width must also be less than the difference between the period and the edge time
as shown below. The instrument will adjust pulse edge time first and then limit pulse width as needed
to accommodate the period. From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will also be generated.
Pulse Width ≤ [Period - ((Leading Edge Time + Trailing Edge Time) * 0.625)]

l

The pulse width must also be greater than the total time of one edge as shown below.
Pulse Width ≥ [(Leading Edge Time + Trailing Edge Time) * 0.625]

[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:RAMP:SYMMetry {<percent>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:RAMP:SYMMetry? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the symmetry percentage for ramp waves.
Parameter
0 to 100, default 100

Typical Return
+5.000000000000000E+01

Set symmetry to 50%:
FUNC:RAMP:SYMM 50
l

Symmetry represents the amount of time per cycle that the ramp wave is rising (assuming that the
waveform polarity is not inverted).

Symmetry 0%

Symmetry 100%

l

For ramp waveforms, the APPLy:RAMP command overrides the current symmetry setting and selects
100%. To set a symmetry other than 100%, select the ramp waveform output with the FUNCtion
RAMP command, then use FUNCtion:RAMP:SYMMetry to set the symmetry.

l

The symmetry setting is remembered when you change from ramp wave to another function. When
you return to the ramp wave function, the previous symmetry is used.

l

When ramp is the modulating waveform for AM, FM, PM, or PWM, the symmetry setting does not
apply. The instrument always uses a ramp waveform with 100% symmetry.

[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:SQUare:DCYCle {<percent>|MINimum|MAXimum}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FUNCtion:SQUare:DCYCle? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets duty cycle percentage for square wave.
Parameter

Typical Return

0.01 to 99.99, subject to limitation of 16 ns minimum pulse width;
default 50

+5.000000000000000E+01

Set duty cycle to 30%:
FUNC:SQU:DCYC 30
Sets the duty cycle to its minimum value:
FUNC:SQU:DCYC MIN
l

Duty cycle represents the amount of time per cycle that the square wave is at a high level (assuming
normal polarity).

l

For square waveforms, APPLy:SQUare replaces the current duty cycle setting with 50%. To set a duty
cycle other than 50%, select the square wave with FUNCtion SQUare, then use FUNCtion:SQUare:DCYCle.

l

The duty cycle setting is remembered when you change from square wave to another function. When
you return to square wave, the previous duty cycle is used.

l

Limits Due to Frequency: As frequency is increased, minimum and maximum duty cycle limits are
adjusted to maintain a minimum pulse width of 16 ns (33500 Series), 5 ns (33600 Series up to 4 Vpp),
or 8 ns (33600 Series up to 10 Vpp). For example, at 1 MHz the minimum duty cycle on the 33500 Series is 1.60% and maximum duty cycle is 98.40%. At 10 MHz, the minimum duty cycle is 16.00% and
the maximum duty cycle is 84.00%.

l

If you select a square waveform as the modulating waveform for AM, FM, PM, or PWM, the instrument always uses a square wave with 50% duty cycle.

Parameter

Typical Return

From reciprocal of maximum square wave frequency to 1,000,000 s,

+5.000000000000000E-01

default 1 ms
Set period to 500 ms (two methods):
FUNC:SQUare:PER .5
FUNC:SQUare:PER 500 ms
l

Function Limitations: If you change to a function whose minimum period exceeds the value set by this
command, the period is adjusted to the new function's minimum pulse. For example, if you set a
period of 2 µs and then change to the ramp function, the instrument adjusts the period to 5 µs (the
minimum for ramps). From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will also be generated.
From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will also be generated.

*OPC
Sets "Operation Complete" (bit 0) in the Standard Event register at the completion of the current operation.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
(none)

Set Operation Complete bit:
*OPC
l

The purpose of this command is to synchronize your application with the instrument.

l

Used in triggered sweep, triggered burst, list, or arbitrary waveform sequence modes to provide a
way to poll or interrupt the computer when the *TRG or INITiate[:IMMediate] is complete.

l

Other commands may be executed before Operation Complete bit is set.

l

The difference between *OPC and *OPC? is that *OPC? returns "1" to the output buffer when the current operation completes. This means that no further commands can be sent after an *OPC? until it
has responded. In this way an explicit polling loop can be avoided. That is, the IO driver will wait for
the response.

*OPC?
Returns 1 to the output buffer after all pending commands complete.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
1

Return 1 when all previous commands complete:
*OPC?
l

The purpose of this command is to synchronize your application with the instrument.

l

Other commands cannot be executed until this command completes.

l

The difference between *OPC and *OPC? is that *OPC? returns "1" to the output buffer when the current operation completes. This means that no further commands can be sent after an *OPC? until it
has responded. In this way an explicit polling loop can be avoided. That is, the IO driver will wait for
the response.

*OPT?
Returns a quoted string identifying any installed options.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
"0,MEM,SEC,IQP"

Returns installed options (example: standard timebase, extended memory, security, IQ player)

310

*RCL {0|1|2|3|4}
*SAV {0|1|2|3|4}
Recalls (*RCL) or saves (*SAV) instrument state in specified non-volatile location. Previously stored state
in location is overwritten (no error is generated).
For 33600 Series instruments, the state files associated with *SAV and *RCL are saved in
files called STATE_0.STA through STATE_4.STA. These files are located in the Settings directory of internal memory. You can manage these files using MMEMory commands.

Parameter
{0|1|2|3|4}

Typical Return
(none)

Recall state from location 1:
*RCL 1
l

The instrument has five non-volatile storage locations to store instrument states. Location 0 holds the
instrument power down state. Use locations 1, 2, 3, and 4 to store other states. You can configure the
instrument to recall the power-down state when power is restored (MEM:STAT:REC:AUTO).

l

State storage "remembers" the selected function (including arbitrary waveforms), frequency, amplitude, DC offset, duty cycle, symmetry, as well as any modulation parameters in use. Also remembers
front panel display state (DISP).

l

When shipped from the factory, locations 1 through 4 are empty, and location 0 has power-on state.

l

From the remote interface only, you can use location 0 to store a fifth instrument state (you cannot
store to this location from the front panel). However, location 0 is overwritten when power is cycled.

l

You can assign a user-defined name to each of locations 0 through 4.

l

States stored in memory are not affected by *RST.

l

If you delete an arbitrary waveform from non-volatile memory after storing the instrument state, the
waveform data is lost and the instrument will not output the waveform when the state is recalled; it
will output the built-in "exponential rise" instead.

l

The front panel uses MMEMory subsystem for state storage.

311

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

*RST
Resets instrument to factory default state, independent of MEMory:STATe:RECall:AUTO setting.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
(none)

Reset the instrument:
*RST
l

Does not affect stored instrument states, stored arbitrary waveforms, or I/O settings; these are stored
in non-volatile memory.

l

Aborts a sweep or burst in progress.

*SRE <enable_value>
*SRE?
Service Request Enable. This command enables bits in the enable register for the Status Byte Register
group.
Parameter

Decimal sum of the bits in the register (table below), default 0. For example, to enable bit 2
(value 4), bit 3 (value 8), and bit 7 (value 128), the decimal sum would be 140 (4 + 8 +
128). Default 0.

Typical
Return
+24

Enable bits 3 and 4 in the enable register:
*SRE 24
l

To enable specific bits, specify the decimal value corresponding to the binary-weighted sum of the
bits in the register. The selected bits are summarized in the "Master Summary" bit (bit 6) of the Status
Byte Register. If any of the selected bits change from 0 to 1, the instrument generates a Service
Request signal.

l

*CLS clears the event register, but not the enable register.

l

*PSC (power-on status clear) determines whether Status Byte enable register is cleared at power on.
For example, *PSC 0 preserves the contents of the enable register through power cycles.

l

Status Byte enable register is not cleared by *RST.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

312

*STB?
Read Status Byte Query. This command queries the condition register for the Status Byte Register group.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
+40

Read condition register (with bits 3 and 5 set):
*STB?
l

Similar to a Serial Poll, but processed like any other instrument command. Register is read-only; bits
not cleared when read.

l

Returns same result as a Serial Poll, but "Master Summary" bit (bit 6) is not cleared by *STB?.

l

Power cycle or *RST clears all bits in condition register.

l

Returns a decimal value that corresponds to the binary-weighted sum of all bits set in the register.
For example, with bit 3 ( value 8) and bit 5 (value 32) set (and corresponding bits enabled), the query
returns +40.

*TRG
Trigger Command. Triggers a sweep, burst, arbitrary waveform advance, or LIST advance from the remote
interface if the bus (software) trigger source is currently selected (TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce BUS).
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
(none)

Send immediate trigger to initiate a burst:
BURS:STAT ON
BURS:MODE TRIG
TRIG:SOUR BUS
*TRG

313

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

*TST?
Self-Test Query. Performs a complete instrument self-test. If test fails, one or more error messages will
provide additional information. Use SYSTem:ERRor? to read error queue.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
+0 (pass) or +1 (one or more tests failed)

Perform self-test:
*TST?
l

A power-on self-test occurs when you turn on the instrument. This limited test assures you that the
instrument is operational.

l

A complete self-test (*TST?) takes approximately 15 seconds. If all tests pass, you have high confidence that the instrument is fully operational.

l

Passing *TST displays "Self-Test Passed" on the front panel. Otherwise, it displays "Self-Test Failed"
and an error number. See Service and Repair - Introduction for instructions on contacting support or
returning the instrument for service.

*WAI
Configures the instrument to wait for all pending operations to complete before executing any additional
commands over the interface.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
(none)

Wait until all pending operations complete.
*WAI
l

For example, you can use this with the *TRG command to ensure that the instrument is ready for a
trigger:

The instrument uses three different type of registers to enable, flag and track instrument features.
l

An enable register defines which bits in the event register will be reported to the Status Byte register
group. You can write to or read from an enable register.

l

A condition register continuously monitors the state of the instrument. The bits in the condition
register are updated in real time and the bits are not latched or buffered.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

314

l

An event register is a read-only register that latches the various events from the condition register.
There is no buffering in this register; while an event bit is set, subsequent events corresponding to that
bit are ignored.

INITiate Subsystem
The INITiate subsystem controls how the instrument moves from the "idle" state to the "wait for trigger"
state. You may do this one channel at a time, or for both channels with the "ALL" keyword.
Example
This program uses INITiate[1|2][:IMMediate] with TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce and TRIGger[1|2]:COUNt. The
TRIG:SOUR EXT command configures the channel for external triggering, and TRIG:COUNT sets the trigger count to 10. The INITiate command places the instrument in the "wait-for-trigger" state. The trigger
will occur when the rear-panel Ext Trig line is pulsed (high by default). The channel will return to idle
after the trigger count of 10 has been satisfied. Another INIT command would then be necessary to
restart the acceptance of triggers from the external trigger input line.
INIT:CONT OFF
TRIG:SOUR EXT
TRIG:COUNT 10
INIT
INITiate[1|2]:CONTinuous {ON|1|OFF|0}
INITiate[1|2]:CONTinuous?
INITiate:CONTinuous:ALL {ON|1|OFF|0}
Specifies whether the trigger system for one or both channels (ALL) always returns to the "wait-for-trigger" state (ON) or remains in the "idle" state (OFF), ignoring triggers until INITiate:IMMediate is issued.
Parameter
{ON|1|OFF|0}, default ON

Typical Return
0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

Configure both channels for continuous trigger:
INIT:CONT:ALL ON
l

Once the channel is triggered, it leaves the wait-for-trigger state and enters the "action-in-progress"
state (for example, burst-in-progress or sweep-in-progress). The action-in-progress state can be
lengthy, and during this state triggers are ignored (will not count against number of triggers specified
by TRIGger[1|2]:COUNt).

l

With INIT:CONT ON, the trigger count is meaningless because there is no way to distinguish the completion of one trigger count from the first trigger of the next trigger count. If you need counted triggers, you must set INIT:CONT OFF.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

316

INITiate[1|2][:IMMediate]
INITiate[:IMMediate]:ALL
Changes state of triggering system for both channels (ALL) from "idle" to "wait-for-trigger" for the number of triggers specified by TRIGger[1|2]:COUNt.
l

Once the channel is triggered, it leaves the wait-for-trigger state and enters the "action-in-progress"
state (for example, burst-in-progress or sweep-in-progress). The action-in-progress state can be
lengthy, and during this state triggers are ignored (will not count against number of triggers specified
by TRIGger[1|2]:COUNt).
Parameter

(none)

Typical Return
(none)

Change both channels to the wait-for-trigger state:
INIT:IMM:ALL
l

The trigger system is armed by INITiate[:IMMediate]. Once the trigger count is satisfied, the trigger
system returns to idle state and ignores further triggers. The triggered function will be left in
whatever state is achieved with the count of triggers. Rearming the trigger system with another INITiate[:IMMediate] allows further triggers to apply.

l

Use ABORt to return instrument to idle.

l

If the specified channel has INIT:CONT set ON, INITiate[1|2]:IMMediate and INIT[:IMMediate]:ALL have
no effect on the trigger system and error -213 will be generated.

LIST_DWELl - sets amount of time each frequency in list is generated.
LIST_FREQuency - Specify up to 128 frequencies as a list (frequencies may also be read from or saved to
a file using MMEMory:LOAD:LIST[1|2] and MMEMory:STORe:LIST.
LIST_FREQuency_POINts - Returns number of points in a frequency list.
For LIST programming example, see Create a List of Frequencies.
[SOURce[1|2]:]LIST:DWELl {<seconds>|MINimum|MAXimum}
[SOURce[1|2]:]LIST:DWELl? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets dwell time, the amount of time each frequency in a frequency list is generated.
Parameter

MARKer Subsystem
The MARKer subsystem configures the point within an arbitrary waveform, sweep, or burst at which the
front panel Sync signal goes low.
Commands and Queries
l

[SOURce[1|2]:]MARKer:CYCle {<cycle_num>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault} - cycle of a burst at which
Sync signal goes low

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]MARKer:FREQuency {<frequency>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault} - frequency at which
Sync signal goes low

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]MARKer:POINt {<sample_number>|MINimum|MAXimum} - point in an arbitrary waveform at which Sync signal goes low

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

322

If and only if the SYNC:MODE is set to MARKer, each of these commands causes sync/marker to transition to high at start of burst, sweep, or arbitrary waveform. OUTPut:SYNC:POLarity may reverse this.
[SOURce[1|2]:]MARKer:CYCle {<cycle_num>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]MARKer:CYCLe? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the marker cycle number at which the front panel Sync signal goes low in a burst mode operation.
OUTPut:SYNC:POLarity may reverse this.

Typical Return

Whole number from 2 to number of cycles in the burst plus one
(NCYCles+1), default 2

+2.000000000000000E+03

Set the marker cycle to 2000:
MARK:CYCL 2000
l

This is valid only if burst is enabled and OUTP:SYNC:MODE is MARKer.

l

With burst enabled, the marker cycle must be less than or equal to the number of cycles in the burst
plus one. Attempting to set the marker cycle outside this range will set marker cycle equal to middle
of burst. From the remote interface, a "Settings conflict" error will also be generated.

[SOURce[1|2]:]MARKer:FREQuency {<frequency>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]MARKer:FREQuency? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets the marker frequency at which the front panel Sync signal goes low during a sweep.

MEMory Subsystem
The MEMory subsystem works with instrument state files that are saved to (*SAV) and recalled from
(*RCL) non-volatile storage locations numbered 0 through 4.
For 33600 Series instruments, the state files associated with *SAV and *RCL are saved in
files called STATE_0.STA through STATE_4.STA. These files are located in the Settings directory of internal memory. You can manage these files using MMEMory commands.

Example
MEM:STAT:DEL 3
*SAV 3
MEM:STAT:VAL? 3
MEM:STAT:NAME 3,PATS_STATE
MEM:STAT:CAT?

MMEMory Subsystem
The MMEMory subsystem manages the file system in the instrument or on an external USB file system.
The file system can store and load several file formats.
The "INT:\" flash memory file system inside the instrument is always present. If a USB file storage device
(sometimes called a flash drive, thumb drive, or jump drive) is plugged into the front panel USB port, it
appears as "USB:\" to the instrument.

Folder and file formats
Many MMEMory commands refer to folders and files. These have specific structures, described below.
Format for a <folder>
l

The format for <folder> is "<drive>:<path>", where <drive> can be INTernal or USB, and <path> is an
absolute folder path.
l

INTernal specifies the internal flash file system. USB specifies a front panel USB storage device.

l

Absolute paths begin with "\" or "/" and start at the root folder of <drive>.

l

The folder name specified in <path> cannot exceed 240 characters.

l

The specified folder must exist and cannot be marked hidden or system.

l

If <drive>:<path> is omitted, the folder specified by MMEMory:CDIRectory is used.

l

If <drive> is omitted:
l

The path is treated as a relative path and appended to the folder specified by
MMEMory:CDIRectory.

l

Absolute paths are NOT allowed.

Format for a <file>
l

The format for <file1> and <file2> is "[<drive>:<path>]<file_name>", where <drive> can be INTernal or
USB, and <path> must be an absolute folder path.
l

INTernal specifies the internal flash file system. USB specifies a front panel USB storage device.

l

If <drive>:<path> is omitted, the folder specified by MMEMory:CDIRectory is used.

l

Absolute paths begin with "\" or "/" and start at the root folder of <drive>.

l

Folder and file names cannot contain the following characters: \ / : * ? " < > |

l

The combination of folder and file name cannot exceed 240 characters.

l

The source file and folder and the destination folder must exist and cannot be marked hidden or
system.

l

If the destination file exists, it is overwritten, unless marked as hidden or system.

l

If <drive> is omitted:
l

The path is treated as a relative path and appended to the folder specified by
MMEMory:CDIRectory.

l

Absolute paths are NOT allowed.

Mass Memory (MMEMory) and State Storage
The front panel uses the MMEM subsystem, not the MEM subsystem, to save states. If you save a state
with the front panel, you can still access it with SCPI. However, a state saved into the MEM subsystem
via SCPI using *SAV cannot be retrieved from the front panel.
For example, configure the instrument as desired and insert a USB drive into the front panel. Then enter
the following commands. If you do not have a USB drive change "USB:\" to "INT:\" to use the instrument's internal flash drive instead.
MMEMory:CDIRectory "USB:\"
MMEMory:MDIRerctory "States"
MMEMory:STORe:STATE "USB:\States\State1"
To return to this state at any time:
MMEMory:LOAD:STATE "USB:\States\State1"
You can also recall a state file from the front panel by pressing [System] > Store/Recall.
MMEMory:CATalog[:ALL]? [<folder>]
Returns a list of all files in the current mass storage directory, including internal storage and the USB
drive.
Parameter

Typical Return

Any valid folder name; defaults to folder selected by

+1000000000,+327168572,
"command.exe,,375808",
"MySetup.sta,STAT,8192",
"MyWave.csv,ASC,11265"

MMEMory:CDIRectory

List all files in the folder MyData on the front panel USB storage device:
MMEM:CAT? "USB:\MyData"
l

The catalog takes the following form:
<mem_used>,<mem_free>{,"<file listing>"}
The instrument returns two numeric values and a string for each file in the folder. The first numeric
value indicates the number of bytes of storage used on the drive. The second indicates the number of
bytes of storage available. Each <file listing> is in the format "<file_name>,<file_type>,<file_size>"
(the quotation marks are also returned), where <file_name> is the name of the file including file extension, if any; <file_type> is either STAT for STATe (.sta) files, ASC for DATA (.csv) files, FOLD for folders,
or null for all other file extensions; <file_size> is the size of the file in bytes.

l

If no files exist, only <mem_used>,<mem_free> is returned.

l

Because the instrument uses a small amount of space in the flash file system for internal use, the
<mem_used> value will not be zero even if no user files exist on the drive.

MMEMory:STORe:DATA[1|2] <filename>
Stores the specified arb segment(.arb/.barb) or arb sequence (.seq) data in the channel specified volatile
memory (default, channel 1) in INTERNAL or USB memory.
Parameter
Any valid file name

Typical Return
(none)

Store an arbitrary sequence loaded in volatile memory on channel 1 to the internal drive.
MMEM:STOR:DATA "INT:\Sequence1.seq"
l

When you store an arbitrary waveform segment or sequence (MMEMory:STORe:DATA[1|2]), the instrument's current settings (voltage values, sample rate, filter type, and so on) are stored in the segment
or sequence file. When you play the file for the first time with FUNCtion:ARBitrary, these settings are
loaded and override the instrument's current settings. If you have manually edited a segment or
sequence file such that the instrument settings have been removed, the instrument settings will not
be changed when you execute FUNCtion:ARBitrary.

l

If the destination file exists, it is overwritten, unless marked as hidden or system.

l

If an arbitrary waveform sequence file (.seq) is specified, all the arbitrary waveform segment file
names associated with the sequence are stored in the file.

l

Command will error if the specified arbitrary waveform segment or arbitrary waveform sequence is
not found in volatile memory.

MMEMory:UPLoad? <filename>

OUTPut Subsystem
The OUTPut subsystem controls the front panel channel output and Sync connectors and the rear-panel
Ext Trig connector:
l

OUTPut[1|2] {ON|1|OFF|0} - front panel channel output connector state

l

OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD {<ohms>|INFinity|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault} - output termination impedance

l

OUTPut[1|2]:MODE {NORMal|GATed} - channel output mode

l

OUTPut[1|2]:POLarity {NORMal|INVerted} - output waveform polarity

l

OUTPut:SYNC {ON|1|OFF|0} - front panel Sync connector state

339

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

l

OUTPut[1|2]:SYNC:MODE? - sync signal mode

l

OUTPut[1|2]:SYNC:POLarity {NORMal|INVerted} - sync waveform polarity

l

OUTPut:SYNC:SOURce {CH1|CH2} - channel used to drive sync signal

l

OUTPut:TRIGger {ON|1|OFF|0} - rear-panel Ext Trig connector state

l

OUTPut:TRIGger:SLOPe {POSitive|NEGative} - "trigger out" polarity

l

OUTPut:TRIGger:SOURce {CH1|CH2} - channel for driving output trigger

OUTPut[1|2] {ON|1|OFF|0}
OUTPut[1|2]?
Enables or disables the front panel output connector.
Parameter

Typical Return

{ON|1|OFF|0}, default OFF

0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

Enable output connector for channel 1:
OUTP ON
l

When output is enabled, the front panel channel output key is illuminated.

l

The APPLy commands override current OUTPut setting and enable the channel output connector.

l

If excessive external voltage is applied to the front panel channel output connector, an error message
appears and output is disabled. To re-enable output, remove overload from the output connector and
send OUTPut ON.

l

OUTPut changes the state of the channel output connector by switching the output relay, without
zeroing output voltage. Therefore, output may glitch for about a millisecond until signal stabilizes.
Minimize glitching by first minimizing amplitude (VOLTage MIN) and setting offset to 0
(VOLTage:OFFSet 0) before changing output state.

l

This command also toggles the output impedance between 50 Ω (ON) and high (>1MΩ) impedance
(OFF).

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

340

OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD {<ohms>|INFinity|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets expected output termination. Should equal the load impedance attached to the output.
Parameter
1 Ω to 10 kΩ, default 50 Ω

Typical Return
+5.000000000000000E+02

Set output impedance to 300 Ω:
OUTP:LOAD 300
Set output impedance to "high impedance":
OUTP:LOAD INF
l

The specified value is used for amplitude, offset, and high/low level settings.

l

The instrument has a fixed series output impedance of 50 Ω to the front panel channel connectors. If
the actual load impedance differs from the value specified, the displayed amplitude and offset levels
will be incorrect. The load impedance setting is simply a convenience to ensure that the displayed
voltage matches the expected load.

l

If you change the output termination setting, the displayed output amplitude, offset, and high/low
levels are adjusted (with no error generated). If the amplitude is 10 Vpp and you change the output
termination setting from 50 Ω to "high impedance" (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF), the displayed amplitude
doubles to 20 Vpp. Changing from "high impedance" to 50 Ω halves the displayed amplitude. The output termination setting does not affect the actual output voltage; it only changes the values displayed
and queried from the remote interface. Actual output voltage depends on the connected load.

l

You cannot specify output amplitude in dBm if output termination is set to high impedance. The units
are automatically converted to Vpp. See VOLT:UNIT for details.

l

You cannot change the output termination setting with voltage limits enabled; the instrument cannot
know which output termination settings the voltage limits apply to. To change the output termination
setting, disable voltage limits, set the new termination value, adjust voltage limits, and re-enable
voltage limits.

l

If INF (high impedance) is selected, the query returns 9.9E+37.

OUTPut[1|2]:MODE {NORMal|GATed}
OUTPut[1|2]:MODE?
Enables (GATed) or disables (NORMal) gating of the output waveform signal on and off using the trigger
input.
Parameter
{NORMal|GATed}, default NORMal

Typical Return
GAT or NORM

Enable gated output:
OUTP:MODE GAT
l

The effect of gating is independent of waveform phase or timing of any sort. When trigger input is
asserted, the output signal is generated. When trigger is not asserted, the waveform continues to be
generated internally, but it is not routed to channel output connector.

l

Gating does not change channel output termination (does not operate output on/off relay).

OUTPut[1|2]:POLarity {NORMal|INVerted}
OUTPut[1|2]:POLarity?
Inverts waveform relative to the offset voltage.
Parameter
{NORMal|INVerted}, default NORMal

Typical Return
NORM or INV

Set output polarity to INVerted:
OUTP:POL INV
l

NORMal: waveform goes in one direction at the beginning of the cycle;
INVerted: waveform goes in other.

l

As shown below, the waveform is inverted relative to the offset voltage. The offset voltage remains
unchanged when the waveform is inverted.

l

The Sync signal associated with an inverted waveform is not inverted.

OUTPut:SYNC {ON|1|OFF|0}
OUTPut:SYNC?
Disables or enables the front panel Sync connector.
Parameter

Typical Return

{ON|1|OFF|0}, default ON

0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

Disable front panel Sync connector:
OUTP:SYNC OFF
l

Disabling the Sync signal reduces output distortion at lower amplitudes.

l

For more details on the Sync signal for each waveform function, see Sync Output Signal.

l

When Sync is disabled, the output level on the Sync connector is a logic "low."

l

Inverting a waveform (OUTPut[1|2]:POLarity INV) does not invert the Sync signal.

OUTPut[1|2]:SYNC:POLarity?
Sets the desired output polarity of the Sync output to trigger external equipment that may require falling
or rising edge triggers.
Parameter

Typical Return

{NORMal|INVerted}, default NORMal

NORM or INV

Set the instrument's output sync connector to normal behavior:
OUTP:SYNC:POL NORM
l

NORMal: voltage on Sync output connector is near zero, and rises when a Sync event occurs. Voltage
stays high (approximately 3.3 V into high impedance) until Sync signal is de-asserted, when it falls
back to near zero.

l

INVerted: opposite of NORMal.

l

The Sync signal may be derived from either channel in a two-channel instrument
(OUTPut:SYNC:SOURce), and from several operating modes of the Sync signal
(OUTPut:SYNC:MODE).

OUTPut:SYNC:SOURce {CH1|CH2}
OUTPut:SYNC:SOURce?

OUTPut:TRIGger {ON|1|OFF|0}
OUTPut:TRIGger?
Disables or enables the "trigger out" signal for sweep and burst modes.
Parameter

Typical Return

{ON|1|OFF|0}, default OFF

0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

Enable trigger out signal:
OUTP:TRIG ON
l

When enabled, a pulse with the specified edge direction (OUTPut:TRIGger:SLOPe) is output from the
rear-panel Ext Trig connector at the beginning of the burst or sweep.

l

In triggered burst mode:

l

l

With TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce IMMediate, instrument outputs square wave with 50% duty cycle from
the Ext Trig connector. The waveform period equals the burst period (BURSt:INTernal:PERiod).

l

With TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce EXTernal or BURSt:MODE GAT, the instrument disables "trigger out."
The rear-panel Ext Trig connector cannot be used for both operations simultaneously (an externally-triggered waveform uses the same connector to trigger sweep or burst).

l

With TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce BUS, the instrument outputs a pulse (>1 μs pulse width on the 33500
Series and 100 ns on the 33600 Series) from the Ext Trig connector at the beginning of each
sweep or burst.

In frequency sweep mode:
l

With TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce IMMediate, the instrument outputs a square wave with a 50% duty
cycle (the rising edge is the sweep trigger) from the Ext Trig connector. Waveform period equals
to the sweep time (SWEep:TIME).

l

With TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce EXTernal, instrument disables the "trigger out" signal. The rear-panel
Ext Trig connector cannot be used for both operations simultaneously (an externally-triggered
sweep uses the same connector to trigger the sweep).

l

With TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce BUS, the instrument outputs a pulse (>1 μs pulse width on the 33500
Series and 100 ns on the 33600 Series) from the Ext Trig connector at the beginning of each
sweep or burst.

OUTPut:TRIGger:SLOPe {POSitive|NEGative}
OUTPut:TRIGger:SLOPe?
Selects whether the instrument uses the rising edge or falling edge for the "trigger out" signal.
Parameter

Typical Return

{POSitive|NEGative}, default POSitive

POS or NEG

Set trigger slope to NEGative (falling edge):
OUTP:TRIG:SLOP NEG
l

POSitive outputs a rising edge pulse; NEGative outputs a falling edge pulse.

l

When enabled using OUTPut:TRIGger, a pulse with the specified edge direction is output from the
rear-panel Trig Out connector at the beginning of a sweep or burst.

OUTPut:TRIGger:SOURce {CH1|CH2}
OUTPut:TRIGger:SOURce?
Selects the source channel used by trigger output on a two-channel instrument. The source channel
determines what output signal to generate on the trigger out connector.
Parameter
{CH1|CH2}, default CH1

Typical Return
CH1 or CH2

Set output trigger source to CH2:
OUTP:TRIG:SOUR CH2
l

In a two-channel instrument, either channel may be source channel for the trigger output, but channel 2 is not valid for dual arbitrary (IQ) waveforms.

PHASe Subsystem
The PHASe subsystem allows you to adjust the waveform phase; this is useful in channel-to-channel and
channel-to-Sync applications. This subsystem also allows you to use the 10 MHz Out and 10 MHz In
rear-panel connectors to synchronize multiple instruments.
l

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe {<angle>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault} - sets phase offset of output waveform
(not available for arbitrary waveforms or noise)

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:ARBitrary {<angle>|MINimum|MAXimum} - sets the offset for the currently
selected arbitrary waveform

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:MODulation {<angle>|MINimum|MAXimum} - sets the phase of the internal
modulation source when modulating by the internal source

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:REFerence - sets new zero-phase reference point without changing instrument
output

347

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:SYNChronize - synchronizes phase of both internal channels on a two-channel
instrument.

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:UNLock:ERRor:STATe {ON|1|OFF|0} - specifies whether instrument generates
an error upon losing phase-lock

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe {<angle>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets waveform's phase offset angle.
Parameter
-360 to +360 degrees, -2π to +2π radians, or -(period) to +(period), as
specified by UNIT:ANGLe. Default 0.

Typical Return
+1.5000000000000E+01

Set channel 1 phase offset to 15 degrees:
UNIT:ANGL DEG
PHAS 15
l

Phase offset is independent of burst phase (BURSt:PHASe).

l

This command does not modify channel's primary phase generator; it simply adds phase offset.

l

This command also useful for modifying phase relationship between channels in a two-channel
instrument and between the channel and its sync signal.

l

In a two-channel instrument, use PHASe:SYNChronize to synchronize the phases of the two internal
channels. Each channel will retain its current phase offset, but the two channels will have a common
reference point so the channel-to-channel phase difference will be known.

l

When synchronizing the phase of multiple instruments (ROSC commands), the phase command
allows adjustment of the phase relationship between the instruments.

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:ARBitrary {<angle>|MINimum|MAXimum}
[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:ARBitrary?
Sets the offset for the currently selected arbitrary waveform in either degrees, radians, seconds or
samples. The default units of the <angle> parameter are set by UNIT:ARBitrary:ANGLe.
This command applies only to the 33600 Series and arbitrary waveforms of at least 64
samples.

Parameter

Typical Return

From -360 to 360 (DEGree)
From -2π to 2π (RADian)
From -arbitrary waveform period to +arbitrary waveform period
(SECond)
From -(number of samples-1) to +(number of samples - 1) (SAMPle)

UNIT:ARB:ANGL DEG
PHAS:ARB 30
l

This parameter affects the phase of the currently selected arbitrary waveform only. For other functions, see [SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe.

l

This parameter affects the phase of the arbitrary in normal continuous mode, modulation mode, and
sweep mode. In burst mode, the arbitrary waveform phase is controlled by [SOURce
[1|2]BURSt:PHASe.

l

When an arbitrary waveform is loaded into memory, its initial phase is zero; it does not inherit the
phase of the currently selected arbitrary waveform. Each arbitrary waveform retains its own phase setting while in memory.

l

The phase of the arbitrary waveform is defined with respect to all the points in the arbitrary waveform
record. For example, setting the arbitrary phase to 180 degrees on a 64-sample arbitrary waveform
will rotate the play of the waveform such that it will begin (as indicated by the sync signal) with the
33rd sample and end with the 32nd.

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:MODulation {<angle>|MINimum|MAXimum}
[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:MODulation?

SQU, RAMP, NRAMp, or TRI. This command applies to the 33600 Series only.
This command applies only to the 33600 Series and arbitrary waveforms of at least 64
samples.

The default units of the <angle> parameter are set by UNIT:ANGLe.

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:REFerence
Simultaneously removes the offset set by PHASe and adjusts the primary phase generator by an amount
equivalent to the PHASe setting. This retains the phase relationship set with another instrument while
realigning the sync signal with the output.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
(none)

Reset the zero-phase reference point for channel 1:
PHAS:REF
l

The primary purpose of this command is to establish a zero-point between two connected instruments. For channel-to-channel operation on a two-channel instrument, use PHASe:SYNChronize.

l

Setting a new zero-phase reference point means that the value subsequently returned by a PHASe?
query command is reset to "0", but the output waveform itself does not change.

350

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:SYNChronize
Simultaneously resets all phase generators in the instrument, including the modulation phase generators, to establish a common, internal phase zero reference point. This command does not affect
PHASe setting of either channel; it simply establishes phase difference between channels as the sum of
SOUR1:PHAS and SOUR2:PHAS instead of an arbitrary amount.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return
(none)

Reset all phase generators:
PHAS:SYNC
l

SOURce1 and SOURce2 mean nothing for this command.

l

This command breaks the phase relation with another instrument, because it resets the phase generators.

l

In single channel instruments, this synchronizes the main channel with the internal modulation generator.

l

You can synchronize the phase between the primary signal and the SUM signal by sending [SOURce
[1|2]:]PHASe:SYNChronize after setting the functions for the primary signal and the SUM signal.
Otherwise, the phase between the two signals is arbitrary.

[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:UNLock:ERRor:STATe {ON|1|OFF|0}
[SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe:UNLock:ERRor:STATe?
Enables or disables the generation of an error if the phase-lock is ever lost by the instrument timebase.
The instrument uses one timebase for both channels.
Parameter
{ON|1|OFF|0}, default OFF

Typical Return
0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

Enable the generation of phase-lock errors:
PHASe:UNLock:ERRor:STATe ON
l

SOURce1 and SOURce2 mean nothing for this command.

l

If the phase-lock is lost and the error is enabled, a "Reference phase-locked loop is unlocked" error is
generated.

l

Volatile setting, lost on power cycle.

l

A faulty reference signal applied to the 10 MHz In connector may generate many error messages.

With the External modulating source, deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V
on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you have set the frequency deviation to 180 degrees, then a +5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) corresponds to a +180 degree phase deviation. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation, and
negative signal levels produce negative deviation.

l

When you select an arbitrary waveform as the modulating source, the frequency changes to the frequency of the arbitrary waveform, which is based on the sample rate and the number of points in the
arbitrary waveform.

l

When using an arbitrary waveform for the modulating source, changing this parameter also changes
the cached metadata representing the arbitrary waveform's sample rate. You can also change the
modulating frequency of an arbitrary waveform with FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FREQuency, FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PERiod, and FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe. These commands and the modulation frequency command are directly coupled in order to keep the arbitrary waveform behaving exactly as it
was last played. If you later turn modulation off and select that same arbitrary waveform as the current function, its sample rate (and corresponding frequency based upon the number of points) will be
the same as it was when played as the modulation source.

l

If the internal function is TRIangle, UpRamp, or DnRamp, the maximum frequency is limited to 200
kHz on the 33500 Series or 800 kHz on the 33600 Series. If the internal function is PRBS, the frequency refers to bit rate and is limited as shown here.

l

If you select EXTernal, the carrier waveform is modulated with an external waveform. Specifically:
l

AM: The modulation depth is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (or the optional ±1 V signal level
on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if modulation depth
(AM[:DEPTh]) is 100%, then when the modulating signal is at +5 V (or optionally +1 V on the 33600
Series), the output will be at the maximum amplitude. Similarly, a -5 V modulating signal (or
optionally -1 V on the 33600 Series) produces output at minimum amplitude.

l

FM: If you select the External modulating source, the deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal
level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For
example, if the frequency deviation is 100 kHz, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a 100 kHz increase in frequency. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation and negative signal levels reduce the frequency below the carrier frequency.

l

PM: With the External modulating source, deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you
have set the frequency deviation to 180 degrees, then a +5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the
33600 Series) corresponds to a +180 degree phase deviation. Lower external signal levels produce
less deviation, and negative signal levels produce negative deviation.

l

Pulse as Selected Function: The pulse width or pulse duty cycle deviation is controlled by the ±5 V
signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) present on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you have set the pulse width deviation to 50 μs using the PWM:DEViation
command, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the 33600 Series) corresponds to a 50 μs
width increase. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation.

l

With EXTernal source, the output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSK) is determined by the signal level
on the rear-panel Ext Trig connector. When a logic low is present, the carrier phase or carrier frequency is output. When a logic high is present, the phase shifted phase or hop frequency is output.

l

The maximum external BPSK rate is 1 MHz, and the maximum FSK rate is 1 MHz.

l

Note: the connector used for externally-controlled BPSK or FSK waveforms (Trig In) is not the same
connector that is used for externally-modulated AM, FM, PM, and PWM waveforms (Modulation In).
When used for BPSK or FSK, the Trig In connector does not have adjustable edge polarity and is not
affected by the TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe command.

l

With INTernal source, the rate at which output phase (BPSK) or frequency (FSKey) "shifts" between
the carrier phase or frequency and the alternate phase or frequency is determined by the BPSK rate
(BPSK:INTernal:RATE) or FSK rate (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).

l

A channel may not be its own modulation source.

l

The deviation is a ± deviation, so if the pulse width is 10 ms and the deviation is 4 ms, the width can
vary from 6 to 14 ms.

l

The pulse width deviation cannot exceed the current pulse width, and is also limited by the minimum
pulse width (Wmin):
Width Deviation < Pulse Width – Wmin
and
Width Deviation < Period – Pulse Width – Wmin

l

The pulse width deviation is limited by the current edge time setting.
Width Deviation < Pulse Width – (0.8 x Leading Edge Time) – (0.8 x Trailing Edge Time)
and
Width Deviation < Period – Pulse Width – (0.8 x Leading Edge Time) – (0.8 x Trailing Edge

359

If you select the External modulating source (PWM:SOURce EXTernal), the deviation is controlled by
the ±5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series) present on the rear-panel Modulation In
connector. For example, if you have set the width deviation to 10 μs, then a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the 33600 Series) corresponds to a 10 μs deviation. Lower external signal levels produce
less deviation. Negative signal levels produce negative deviation.

Sets duty cycle deviation in percent of period. This is the peak variation in duty cycle from the underlying
pulse waveform. For example, if duty cycle is 10% and duty cycle deviation is 5%, the duty cycle of the
modulated waveform will vary from 5% to 15%.

l

Duty cycle deviation cannot exceed pulse duty cycle.

l

Duty cycle deviation also limited by minimum pulse width (Wmin):
Duty Cycle Deviation < Duty Cycle – 100 x Wmin ÷ Period
and
Duty Cycle Deviation < 100 – Duty Cycle – 100 x Wmin ÷ Period
where Wmin = 16 ns on the 33500 Series and 5 ns up to 4 Vpp or 8 ns up to 10 Vpp on the
33600 Series.

l

Duty cycle deviation limited by edge time.
Duty Cycle Dev < Duty Cycle – (80 x Leading Edge Time) ÷ Period – (80 x Trailing Edge Time)
÷ Period
and
Duty Cycle Dev < 100 – Duty Cycle – (80 x Leading Edge Time) ÷ Period – (80 x Trailing Edge
Time) ÷ Period

l

With PWM:SOURce EXTernal, deviation is controlled by the ±5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the
33600 Series) on rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, with duty cycle deviation of 5 percent, a +5 V signal level (optionally +1 V on the 33600 Series) corresponds to 5% deviation, an additional 5% of period added to the pulse duty cycle. Lower external signal levels produce less deviation,
and negative signal levels reduce the duty cycle.

RATE Subsystem
The RATE subsystem allows you to couple the outputs' sample rates on a two-channel instrument by specifying the following items:
l

[SOURce[1|2]:]RATE:COUPle[:STATe] {ON|1|OFF|0}

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]RATE:COUPle:MODE {OFFSet|RATio}

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]RATE:COUPle:OFFSet {<sample_rate>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}

l

[SOURce[1|2]:]RATe:COUPle:RATio {<ratio>|MINimum|MAXimum}

[SOURce[1|2]:]RATE:COUPle[:STATe] {ON|1|OFF|0}
[SOURce[1|2]:]RATE:COUPle[:STATe]?
Enables or disables sample rate coupling between channels, or allows one-time copying of one channel's
sample rate into the other channel.
Parameter

Typical Return

{ON|1|OFF|0}, default OFF

0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

Turn on sample rate coupled state:
RATE:COUP ON
l

The ON value starts sample rate coupling in the mode specified by RATE:COUPle:MODE.

l

If the current offset or ratio, combined with the current sample rate settings, would cause either
sample rate to exceed instrument specifications, the instrument will generate an error and the
exceeded sample rate will clip at its maximum or minimum value.

l

If setting mode to RATIO and setting RATIO to 1.0 still exceeds the specifications of either channel, an
error message will be generated and the RATE:COUPle[:STATe] will not be turned ON.

l

Both channels must be configured for FUNCtion ARB in order to enable sample rate coupling.

[SOURce[1|2]:]RATE:COUPle:MODE {OFFSet|RATio}
[SOURce[1|2]:]RATE:COUPle:MODE?
Sets type of sample rate coupling to either a constant sample rate offset (OFFSet) or a constant ratio
(RATio) between the channels' sample rates.
Parameter
{OFFSet|RATio}, default RATio

Typical Return
OFFS or RAT

Set the sample rate coupling mode to OFFSet.
RATE:COUP:MODE OFFSet
l

The default RATio is 1.

l

The default sample rate coupling is OFF.

l

The SOURce[1|2] keyword is ignored; the setting applies to both channels.

[SOURce[1|2]:]RATE:COUPle:OFFSet {<sample_rate>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]RATE:COUPle:OFFSet?
Sets sample rate offset when a two-channel instrument is in sample rate coupled mode OFFSet.
Parameter
Valid values depend on FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer setting. For NORMal

Typical Return
+8.000000000000000E+02

and STEP, the range is between ±250 MSa/s (33500 Series) or ±1
GSa/s (33600 Series). For OFF, the range is between ±62.5 MSa/s
(33500 Series) or ±250 MSa/s (33600 Series). In any case, default is 0.
Set sample rate offset of channel 2 to 10.3 kSa/s higher than sample rate of channel 1.
RATE:COUPle:OFFSet 10300
Sets the sample rate offset of channel 1 to 45 kSa/s below the sample rate of channel 2.
SOUR2:RATE:COUP:OFFS -45000
l

When specifying OFFSet or RATio, the SOURce channel (SOURce1 or SOURce2) is used as the reference channel and the offset or ratio is applied to the other channel. For example, suppose
RATE:COUPle[:STATe] is ON and RATE:COUPle:MODE is OFFSet. Furthermore, suppose channel 1 is
operating at 2 kSa/s, and channel 2 is at 10 kSa/s. The command SOUR1:RATE:COUP:OFFS 2.5
causes Channel 1 to remain at 2 Sa/s, and Channel 2 to be set to 4.5 Sa/s. As one channel's sample
rate changes, the other channel's sample rate changes to maintain the specified coupling.

l

If the sample rate coupling would cause either channel to exceed sample rate specifications for the
present functions, the command will result in an error, and the sample rate will be set to its maximum
or minimum limit for the channel.

[SOURce[1|2]:]RATe:COUPle:RATio {<ratio>|MINimum|MAXimum}
[SOURce[1|2]:]RATe:COUPle:RATio? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets offset ratio between channel sample rates when a two-channel instrument is in sample rate coupled
mode RATio.
Parameter
0.001 to 1000, default 1

Typical Return
+7.500000000000000E-1

Set channel 2's sample rate to twice that of channel 1.
SOUR1:RATE:COUP:RATio 2
Set channel 1's sample rate to 3.14 times that of channel 2.
SOUR2:RATE:COUPle:RAT 3.14
l

When specifying OFFSet or RATio, the SOURce channel (SOURce1 or SOURce2) is used as the reference channel and the offset or ratio is applied to the other channel. For example, suppose the instrument is coupled in RATio mode. Furthermore, suppose channel 1 is operating at 2 kSa/s, and channel
2 is at 10 kSa/s. The command SOUR1:RAT:COUP:RAT 2.5 causes Channel 1 to remain at 2 kSa/s,
and Channel 2 to be set to 5 kSa/s. As one channel's sample rate changes, the other channel's
sample rate changes to maintain the specified coupling.

l

If the sample rate coupling would cause either channel to exceed sample rate specifications for the
present functions, the command will result in an error, and the sample rate will be set to its maximum
or minimum limit for the channel.

ROSCillator Subsystem
The external 10 MHz reference input BNC connector, both the shell and center pin, on the
rear panel of the instrument is isolated up to ±42 Vpk from chassis. The shell of this BNC connector is isolated from the rest of the instrument. Internal circuitry will attempt to keep the
isolated voltage to within ±42 Vpk to chassis. Attempts to float this input beyond ±42 Vpk
from chassis may destroy the instrument and cause a hazard that could result in personal
injury or death.

The instrument 10 MHz output is chassis referenced.

The ROSCillator subsystem controls use of the 10 MHz reference oscillator and external reference oscillator input. The reference oscillator is the primary clock for all waveform synthesis. All waveforms are
phase-locked to the reference oscillator, which therefore controls output signal frequency and phase.
l

ROSCillator:SOURce {INTernal|EXTernal} - selects internal or external reference oscillator source

l

ROSCillator:SOURce:AUTO {ON|OFF} - disables or enables automatic selection of reference oscillator
signal source

l

ROSCillator:SOURce:CURRent? - returns INT or EXT to indicate current reference oscillator source

ROSC:SOURce sets ROSCillator:SOURce:AUTO to OFF, and ROSCillator:SOURce:AUTO ON overrides
ROSC:SOURce. The more recent command (of these two) takes priority.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

ROSCillator:SOURce INTernal uses the instrument's internal oscillator as the reference oscillator. This
may be either standard Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator (TCXO) or the optional Ovenized
Crystal Oscillator (OCXO).
See *OPT? for details on determining whether OCXO is installed. If an external 10 MHz reference signal is
on the rear-panel 10 MHz In connector, the instrument uses the external signal. An icon also appears at
the top right corner of the display to indicate the reference source change.
ROSCillator:SOURce {INTernal|EXTernal}
ROSCillator:SOURce?

Use the external reference oscillator source:
ROSC:SOUR EXT
l

EXTernal: instrument uses signal on the rear-panel 10 MHz In connector as reference, and generates
an error if this signal is absent or the instrument cannot lock to it. In such error cases, instrument output continues, but the frequency will be unstable.

l

INTernal: instrument uses the internal reference oscillator and ignores the signal at the 10 MHz In
connector.

ROSCillator:SOURce:AUTO {ON|OFF}
ROSCillator:SOURce:AUTO?
Disables or enables automatic selection of the reference oscillator.
Parameter
{ON|OFF}, default ON

Typical Return

STATus Subsystem Introduction
The instrument's SCPI status system records various instrument conditions and states in several register
groups.
In this subsystem, an event is something that occurred, even though it may not still be occurring. A condition is something that is currently present. A condition will appear in the event register, but the event
register is read destructive; it is cleared (set to 0) when read.
The STATus commands manipulate bits in two of the enable registers. You can:
l

Enable bits in the Questionable Data enable register (STATus:QUEStionable:ENABle <enable_value>).
Query: STATus:QUEStionable:ENABle?

l

Enable bits in the Operation enable register (STATus:OPERation:ENABle <enable_value>). Query:
STATus:OPERation:ENABle?

l

Clear all bits in the Questionable Data enable register and the Standard Operation enable register
(STATus:PRESet).

The STATus queries accesses information about the status bits in the Questionable Data registers, including:
l

The binary-weighted sum of all bits enabled in the Questionable Data condition register
(STATus:QUEStionable:CONDition?)

l

The binary-weighted sum of all bits enabled in the Questionable Data event register (STATus:QUEStionable[:EVENt]?)

l

The binary-weighted sum of all bits enabled in the Questionable Data enable register (STATus:QUEStionable:ENABle <enable_value>).

The STATus queries also allow you to access information about the status bits in the Operation registers,
including:
l

The binary-weighted sum of all bits enabled in the Operation condition register (STATus:OPERation:CONDition?).

SUM Subsystem Introduction
The SUM subsystem adds a modulation source signal to a channel's primary signal. This allows you to
generate a two-tone signal on one channel, or to add noise to a primary signal. The SUM function uses
the same secondary sources as used by the modulation subsystems.
Only one modulation or SUM function may be active on a channel at a time, so you cannot add noise to an
FM signal using only one channel. For this operation, use COMBine:FEED, which combines both channels
of a two-channel instrument into one channel output connector.
When signals are SUMmed:
l

Their peak amplitude may not exceed the instrument's output rating.

l

No other internal or external modulation is possible on that channel.

You can synchronize the phase between the primary signal and the SUM signal by sending [SOURce
[1|2]:]PHASe:SYNChronize after setting the functions for the primary signal and the SUM signal. Otherwise, the phase between the two signals is arbitrary.
When the source is the other channel, there is a noticeable delay (as much as 350 ns) relative to the carrier even after PHAS:SYNC. Use the Combine feature for the other channel
whenever possible.

Example
To create a SUM waveform:
1. Configure carrier waveform: Use FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage, and VOLTage:OFFSet to specify
the carrier waveform's function, frequency, amplitude, and offset.
2. Select the summing source: The instrument accepts an internal or external modulation source (EXT,
Channel 1, or Channel 2). Select the modulation source with SUM:SOURce. For an external modulation source, skip steps 3 and 4.
3. Configure the summing waveform: Use FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage, and VOLTage:OFFSet commands to configure the summing waveform.
4. Set the amplitude percentage to sum: SUM:AMPLitude.
5. Enable SUM Modulation: SUM:STATe:ON.
6. If using the other channel of a two-channel instrument, synchronize the channels:
PHASe:SYNChronize.

Parameter

Typical Return

Desired SUM signal amplitude in percent of carrier amplitude, from 0
to 100; default 0.1

+3.200000000000000E+00

Set the internal SUM signal amplitude to 1.0% of the signal amplitude:
SUM:AMPL 1.0
PHAS:SYNC
Set the internal sum signal amplitude on channel 2 to 0.15% of the signal amplitude:
SOUR2:SUM:AMPL 0.15
l

You can synchronize the phase between the primary signal and the SUM signal by sending [SOURce
[1|2]:]PHASe:SYNChronize after setting the functions for the primary signal and the SUM signal.
Otherwise, the phase between the two signals is arbitrary.

l

Summed output cannot exceed ±5 V peak output (into a 50 Ω load).

l

If you select the External SUM source (SUM:SOURce EXTernal), the carrier waveform is added to the
external waveform. The summing signal is the ±5 V signal level (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series)
on the rear-panel Modulation In connector. For example, if you have the carrier amplitude of a sine
wave set to 4 Vpp and set the Sum Amplitude to 20% (resulting in a maximum sum contribution of
800 mVpp) using SUM:AMPLitude, then when the EXT signal is at +5 V (optionally +1 V on the 33600
Series), the additive signal output will be at the maximum amplitude of 4.8 Vpp. When the modulating signal is at -5 V (optionally -1 V on the 33600 Series), the additive signal will be at the minimum amplitude of -4.8 Vpp. A modulation input of 0 V would result in a signal equal to the carrier
amplitude.

Parameter
1 μHz to the maximum allowed for the internal function.

Typical Return

Default 100 Hz
The following command sets the summing frequency to 10 kHz on Channel 2:
SOUR2:SUM:INT:FREQ 10000
SOUR2:PHAS:SYNC The following command sets the summing frequency to 1 μHz on Channel 1:
SUM:INT:FREQ MIN
PHAS:SYNC
l

You can synchronize the phase between the primary signal and the SUM signal by sending [SOURce
[1|2]:]PHASe:SYNChronize after setting the functions for the primary signal and the SUM signal.
Otherwise, the phase between the two signals is arbitrary.

l

When you select an arbitrary waveform as the modulating source, the frequency changes to the frequency of the arbitrary waveform, which is based on the sample rate and the number of points in the
arbitrary waveform.

l

When using an arbitrary waveform for the modulating source, changing this parameter also changes
the cached metadata representing the arbitrary waveform's sample rate. You can also change the
modulating frequency of an arbitrary waveform with FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FREQuency, FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PERiod, and FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe. These commands and the modulation frequency command are directly coupled in order to keep the arbitrary waveform behaving exactly as it
was last played. If you later turn modulation off and select that same arbitrary waveform as the current function, its sample rate (and corresponding frequency based upon the number of points) will be
the same as it was when played as the modulation source.

l

If the internal function is TRIangle, UpRamp, or DnRamp, the maximum frequency is limited to 200
kHz on the 33500 Series or 800 kHz on the 33600 Series. If the internal function is PRBS, the frequency refers to bit rate and is limited as shown here.

You can synchronize the phase between the primary signal and the SUM signal by sending [SOURce
[1|2]:]PHASe:SYNChronize after setting the functions for the primary signal and the SUM signal.
Otherwise, the phase between the two signals is arbitrary.

l

SUM:SOURce EXTernal: carrier waveform is summed with external waveform. The amplitude and
polarity of the sum signal is determined by the ±5 V signal level on the rear-panel Modulation In connector (optionally ±1 V on the 33600 Series). For example, if you have set the SUM Amplitude to 2.0
Vpp using SUM:AMPLitude, then when EXT signal is at +5 V, the sum signal will be at 2 Vpp. When
the modulating signal is at -5 V, the sum signal will be at full amplitude and opposite polarity.

[SOURce[1|2]:]SUM:STATe {ON|1|OFF|0}

l

You can synchronize the phase between the primary signal and the SUM signal by sending [SOURce
[1|2]:]PHASe:SYNChronize after setting the functions for the primary signal and the SUM signal.
Otherwise, the phase between the two signals is arbitrary.

l

To avoid multiple waveform changes, enable SUM after you have configured the other sum parameters.

l

Only one modulation mode may be enabled at a time.

l

The instrument will not allow SUM to be enabled when sweep or burst is enabled. When you enable
SUM, the sweep or burst mode is turned off.

l

With SUM:STATe ON, the sum amplitude plus the carrier amplitude may not exceed either the programmed limits or the instrument's output rating. If setting SUM:STATe ON would cause either the
output rating or the limits to be exceeded, SUM:STATe will be set OFF and the instrument will report
a settings conflict error.

397

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

The instrument uses LAN port 5024 for SCPI Telnet sessions, and port 5025 for SCPI
Socket sessions.
Dot Notation Details

Dot-notation addresses ("nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn" where "nnn" is a byte value from 0 to 255) must be expressed
with care, as most PC web software interprets byte values with leading zeros as octal (base 8) numbers.
For example, "192.168.020.011" is actually equivalent to decimal "192.168.16.9" because ".020" is interpreted as "16" expressed in octal, and ".011" as "9". To avoid confusion, use only decimal values from 0 to
255, with no leading zeros.
SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:CONTrol?

Reads the initial Control connection port number for Sockets communications. This connection is used to
send and receive commands and queries.
Parameter
(none)

Typical Return

SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:DHCP {ON|1|OFF|0}
SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:DHCP?

Disables or enables instrument's use of DHCP. The acronym DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol, a protocol for assigning dynamic IP addresses to networked devices. With dynamic addressing,
a device can have a different IP address every time it connects to the network.
ON: instrument tries to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. If a DHCP server is found, it assigns a
dynamic IP address, Subnet Mask, and Default Gateway to the instrument.
OFF or DHCP unavailable: instrument uses the static IP address, Subnet Mask, and Default Gateway during power-on.
If you change this setting, you must send SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:UPDate to
activate the new setting.
Parameter

Typical Return

SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:GATeway? [{CURRent|STATic}]

Assigns a default gateway for the instrument. The specified IP Address sets the default gateway which
allows the instrument to communicate with systems that are not on the local subnet. Thus, this is the
default gateway where packets are sent which are destined for a device not on the local subnet, as
determined by the Subnet Mask setting. If DHCP is enabled (SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:DHCP ), the specified default gateway is not used. However, if the DHCP server fails to assign a valid IP address, the currently configured default gateway will be used. Contact your LAN administrator for details.
If you change this setting, you must send SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:UPDate to activate the new setting.

[SOURce[1|2]:]TRACk {ON|OFF|INVerted}
TRACk?
Causes channels 1 and 2 of a two-channel instrument to output the same signal, or an inverted polarity
signal.
Parameter
{ON|OFF|INVerted}

Typical Return
ON, OFF, or INV

Set channel 2 to output a signal identical to that of channel 1:
TRACk ON
l

Causes all settings of the named channel to be copied to the other channel with exceptions noted
below. This does include frequency list settings and any arbitrary waveforms loaded in memory.

l

With the INVerted option, the tracking channel's amplitude will be inverted, forming a signal similar
to a differential output between Channel 1 and Channel 2. DC Offset is not inverted.

l

When TRACk is ON, voltage limits on both channels apply. If voltage limits on either channel would
prevent the other channel's setup from being applied, the instrument will generate a settings conflict
error and channel tracking will remain OFF.

l

When TRACk is ON, changes to either channel are reflected in both channels. When TRACk is
changed from ON or INV to OFF, the channels will remain in their present setup (frequency, amplitude, and so on), but you may now change one channel without affecting the other channel.

l

Voltage limits may be adjusted in tracking mode, but cannot be set in violation of the current signal.

l

Turning tracking ON sets COMBine:FEED to NONE, turns off FREQuency:COUPle, VOLTage:COUPle,
and RATE:COUPle.

l

TRACK is not allowed if the internal modulation source for the channel being tracked is the other
channel.

VOLTage Subsystem Introduction
The VOLTage subsystem sets parameters related to output voltage.
Example
The following is a typical procedure using the VOLTage subsystem.
1. Select the waveform shape, amplitude and offset: Use APPLy or the equivalent FUNCtion,
FREQuency, VOLTage, and VOLTage:OFFSet commands to select the function, frequency, amplitude,
and offset.
2. Set units for output amplitude:VOLTage:UNIT
3. Set output amplitude:VOLTage
4. Set DC offset voltage:VOLTage:OFFSet
5. Set high and low voltage level:VOLTage:HIGH and VOLTage:LOW
6. Select output voltage limits to protect device under test (DUT):VOLTage:LIMit:HIGH,
VOLTage:LIMit:LOW, and VOLTage:LIMit:STATe
7. Select status of auto-ranging for all output functions:VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO
8. Set voltage coupling to lock amplitude and offset of the channels together (2-channel instruments
only):VOLTageLCOUPle[:STATe]
This example demonstrates the procedure outlined above:

[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage {<amplitude>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage? [{MINimum|MAXimum}]
Sets output amplitude.
Parameter
1 mVpp to maximum allowed for waveform and model, default 100 mVpp

Typical Return
+5.0000000000000E+00

Set output amplitude to 5 Vpp:
VOLT 5 Vpp
l

The relationship between offset voltage and output amplitude is shown below. Vmax is the maximum
peak voltage for the selected output termination (5 V for a 50 Ω load or 10 V for a high-impedance
load).
|Voffset| < Vmax - Vpp/2
If the specified offset voltage is not valid, the instrument will adjust it to the maximum DC voltage
allowed with the specified amplitude. From the remote interface, a "Data out of range" error will also
be generated.

l

Differences between remote and front panel operation:
l

Remote Interface: Setting amplitude from the remote interface can change the offset in order to
achieve the desired amplitude. The instrument will generate either a "Data out of range" or "Settings conflict" error. If the specified offset voltage is not valid, the instrument adjusts it to the maximum allowed with the specified amplitude.

l

Front Panel: Setting amplitude from the front panel will not change the offset setting. If the specified amplitude is not valid, the instrument clips it to the maximum amplitude allowed with the
current offset and generates a "Data out of range" error.

l

Limits Due to Output Termination: If the amplitude is 10 Vpp and you change the output termination
setting from 50 Ω to "high impedance" (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF), the displayed amplitude doubles to
20 Vpp. Changing from "high impedance" to 50 Ω halves the displayed amplitude. The output termination setting does not affect the actual output voltage; it only changes the values displayed and
queried from the remote interface. Actual output voltage depends on the connected load.

l

Limits due to Output Coupling:
l

Differences between remote and front panel operation: If two channels are coupled, both channels' amplitude limitations will be checked before a change in amplitude is executed. If a change
in output amplitude would exceed a LIMIT for either channel, or exceed the instrument's output
specifications for either channel:
l

Remote interface: The instrument will first adjust the offset, then if necessary, the amplitude of
that channel to comply with the voltage limits or specification. The instrument will generate
either a "Data out of range" or "Settings conflict" error.

l

Front panel: The instrument will clip the amplitude value to the maximum value with the current offset setting. A "Data out of range" error will be generated.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

418

l

Specifying Voltage Units: You can set the output amplitude in Vpp, Vrms, or dBm by specifying the
units as part of the VOLTage command VOLT 3.0 VRMS.

Use VOLTage:UNIT to specify output units for all subsequent commands.
You cannot specify output amplitude in dBm if output termination is set to high impedance. The units
are automatically converted to Vpp.
l

Limits Due to Units Selection: Amplitude limits are sometimes determined by the output units selected. This may occur when the units are Vrms or dBm due to the differences in various functions' crest
factors. For example, if you change a 5 Vrms square wave (into 50 Ω) to a sine wave, the instrument
will adjust the amplitude to 3.536 Vrms (the upper limit for sine in Vrms). The remote interface will
also generate a "Settings conflict" error.

l

Arbitrary Waveform Limitations: For arbitrary waveforms, amplitude is limited if the waveform data
points do not span the full range of the output DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). For example, the
built-in "Sinc" waveform does not use the full range of values, so its maximum amplitude is limited to
6.087 Vpp (into 50 Ω).

l

Changing amplitude may briefly disrupt output at certain voltages due to output attenuator switching. The amplitude is controlled, however, so the output voltage will never exceed the current setting
while switching ranges. To prevent this disruption, disable voltage autoranging using
VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO OFF. The APPLy command automatically enables autoranging.

l

You can also set the amplitude (with an associated offset voltage) by specifying a high level
(VOLTage:HIGH) and low level (VOLTage:LOW). For example, if you set the high level to +2 V and the
low level to -3 V, the resulting amplitude is 5 Vpp, with a -500 mV offset.

l

To output a DC voltage level, select the DC voltage function (FUNCtion DC) and then set the offset
voltage (VOLTage:OFFSet). Valid values are between ±5 VDC into 50 Ω or ±10 VDC into an open circuit. While the instrument is in DC mode, setting amplitude has no effect.

[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:COUPle[:STATe] {ON|1|OFF|0}
[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:COUPle[:STATe]?
Enables or disables the maintaining of the same amplitude, offset, range, load, and units on both channels of a two-channel instrument. The command applies to both channels; the SOURce keyword is

Typical Return

Set high voltage level to 4 V:
VOLT:HIGH 4
l

Limits Due to Amplitude: You can set the voltage levels to a positive or negative value with the restrictions shown below. Vpp is the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude for the selected output termination
(10 Vpp into 50 Ω or 20 Vpp into an open circuit).
Vhigh – Vlow≤ Vpp (max) and Vhigh, Vlow≤ Vpp (max)/2

l

Differences between remote and front panel operation:
l

Remote Interface: Setting the high or low level from the remote interface can change the high
level or low level to achieve the desired setting. In this case either a "Data out of range" or "Settings conflict" error will occur. If the high level is set below the low level, the instrument will set
the low level 1 mV less than the high level. If the high level is set below the LOW limit or the instrument output specifications, the low level will be set to the LOW limit or instrument output specification and the high level will be set 1 mV above the low level. A similar set of rules applies if the
low level is set incorrectly.

l

Front Panel: Setting the high or low level from the front panel may clip that level setting in order
to achieve the desired level setting, and a "Data out of range" error will be generated. The high
level cannot be set below the low level from the front panel.

l

Setting the high and low levels also sets the waveform amplitude and offset. For example, if you set
the high level to +2 V and the low level to -3 V, the resulting amplitude is 5 Vpp, with a -500 mV offset.

l

Limits Due to Output Termination: If the amplitude is 10 Vpp and you change the output termination
setting from 50 Ω to "high impedance" (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF), the displayed amplitude doubles to
20 Vpp. Changing from "high impedance" to 50 Ω halves the displayed amplitude. The output termination setting does not affect the actual output voltage; it only changes the values displayed and
queried from the remote interface. Actual output voltage depends on the connected load.

l

Limits due to VOLTage:LIMit:STATe: If voltage limits are enabled, the level settings are checked
against the specified limits (VOLTage:LIMit:HIGH, VOLTage:LIMit:LOW) before a level change is
executed. If an output level change would exceed a LIMIT setting, the level is clipped to the maximum
(or minimum) value allowed that will not exceed the LIMit setting and a "Settings conflict" error will
be generated.

l

Limits due to Output Coupling: If two channels are coupled, limitations are checked on both channels
before a change in level is executed. If a change in level would exceed a LIMIT setting or exceed the
instrument's output specifications for either channel, the level is clipped to the maximum (or minimum) value allowed that will not exceed the LIMit setting and a "Settings conflict" error will be generated.

l

To invert the waveform relative to the offset voltage, use OUTPut[1|2]:POLarity.

Sets the high and low limits for output voltage.

greater than
LOW.
Defaults:
HIGH +50

Typical Return
+5.0000000000000E+00

Set channel 1 output high limit to 5 V:
VOLT:LIMIT:HIGH 5.0
VOLT:LIMIT:STATE ON
l

For voltage limits to be in effect, VOLTage:LIMit:STATe must be ON. If this is the case, and the high
limit is set below the high value of the signal or the low limit is set above the low value of the signal,
the relevant limit will be clipped to the high or low value of the signal. The instrument will generate
either a "Data out of range" or "Settings conflict" error.

l

The high limit sets the highest output voltage allowed to be set, including DC Offset and peak amplitude. It is set in reference to the current OUTPUT[1|2]:LOAD setting. If the specified LOAD impedance is not present at the instrument's output, then the output limit may not represent the actual
voltages at the output connector. For example, if the output impedance is set to 50 Ω, but the actual
load is high impedance, then the actual output peak voltage may be up to twice the specified limit
voltage.

l

Specifying Voltage Units: You can set the output limit voltage only in volts.

l

When VOLTage:COUPle[:STATe] is ON, and VOLTage:LIMit:STATe is ON, voltage limit settings on both
channels affect maximum amplitude and offset voltage settings on both channels. The most restrictive combination of high and low limits from either channel is used.

Set and enable ±2.5 V output limits on channel 1:
VOLT:LIM:HIGH 2.5
VOLT:LIM:LOW -2.5
VOLT:LIM:STAT ON
l

When this is turned ON, if the present settings of amplitude and offset exceed the limits, then the limits will be disabled. The instrument will generate either a "Settings conflict" error.

l

When VOLTage:COUPle[:STATe] is ON, and VOLTage:LIMit:STATe is ON, voltage limit settings on both
channels affect maximum amplitude and offset voltage settings on both channels. The most restrictive combination of high and low limits from either channel is used.

l

Limits are set in reference to the current setting of OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD. If the specified LOAD impedance is not present at the instrument's output, then the output limit may not represent the actual
voltages at the output connector. For example, if the output impedance is set to 50 Ω, but the actual
load is high impedance, then the actual output peak voltage may be up to twice the specified limit
voltage.

l

The relationship between offset voltage and output amplitude is shown below.
|Voffset| < Vmax - Vpp/2

l

Differences between remote and front panel operation:
l

Remote Interface: Setting the offset from the remote interface can change the amplitude in order
to achieve the desired offset setting. The instrument will generate either a "Data out of range" or
"Settings conflict" error.

l

Front Panel: Setting the offset from the front panel will not change the amplitude in order to
achieve the desired offset setting. If the specified offset is not valid, the instrument will clip it to
the maximum offset allowed with the current amplitude and generate a "Data out of range" error.

l

Limits Due to Output Termination: The offset range depends on the output termination setting. For
example, if you set offset to 100 mVDC and then change output termination from 50 Ω to "high impedance," the offset voltage displayed on the front panel doubles to 200 mVDC (no error is generated). If
you change from "high impedance" to 50 Ω, the displayed offset voltage will be halved. See OUTPut
[1|2]:LOAD for details. Changing the output termination setting does not change the voltage present
at the output terminals of the instrument. This only changes the displayed values on the front panel
and the values queried from the remote interface. The voltage present at the instrument's output
depends on the load connected to the instrument. See OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD for details.

l

Limits due to Output Coupling: If two channels are coupled, limitations of setting offset will be
checked on both channels before a change in offset is executed. If a change in offset would exceed a
LIMIT setting, or exceed the instrument's output specifications for either channel:

l

423

l

Remote Interface: First the amplitude and then if necessary, the offset of that channel will be
adjusted to comply with the voltage limits or specification. The instrument will generate either a
"Data out of range" or "Settings conflict" error.

l

Front panel: The offset value is clipped to the maximum value allowed that will not exceed the
LIMit setting, and a "Data out of range" error will be generated.

Arbitrary Waveform Limitations: For arbitrary waveforms, amplitude is limited if the waveform data
points do not span the full range of the output DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). For example, the
built-in "Sinc" waveform does not use the full range of values, so its maximum amplitude is limited to
6.087 Vpp (into 50 Ω).

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

l

Changing amplitude may briefly disrupt output at certain voltages due to output attenuator switching. The amplitude is controlled, however, so the output voltage will never exceed the current setting
while switching ranges. To prevent this disruption, disable voltage autoranging using
VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO OFF. The APPLy command automatically enables autoranging.

l

Setting the high and low levels also sets the waveform amplitude and offset. For example, if you set
the high level to +2 V and the low level to -3 V, the resulting amplitude is 5 Vpp, with a -500 mV offset.

l

To output a DC voltage level, select the DC voltage function (FUNCtion DC) and then set the offset
voltage (VOLTage:OFFSet). Valid values are between ±5 VDC into 50 Ω or ±10 VDC into an open circuit. While the instrument is in DC mode, setting amplitude has no effect.

[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO {OFF|0|ON|1|ONCE}
[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO?
Disables or enables voltage autoranging for all functions. Selecting ONCE performs an immediate autorange and then turns autoranging OFF
Parameter

Typical Return

{OFF|0|ON|1|ONCE}, default ON

0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

Turn voltage autoranging OFF:
VOLT:RANG:AUTO 0
l

In the default mode, autoranging is enabled and the instrument automatically selects the optimal settings for the output waveform generator and attenuator.

l

With autoranging disabled (OFF), the instrument uses the instrument's current gain and attenuator
settings.

l

The APPLy command overrides the voltage autorange setting and automatically enables autoranging
(ON).

l

Disabling autoranging eliminates momentary disruptions caused by attenuator switching while changing amplitude. However, the amplitude and offset accuracy and resolution (and waveform fidelity)
may be adversely affected when reducing the amplitude below the expected range change.

l

If a VOLTage:COUPle[:STATe] is ON, changing this setting on either channel changes it on both.

[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:UNIT {VPP|VRMS|DBM}
[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:UNIT?

Typical Return

VPP, VRMS, or DBM

Set output amplitude units to Vrms:
VOLT:UNIT VRMS
l

Does not affect offset voltage (VOLTage:OFFSet), high level (VOLTage:HIGH) or low level
(VOLTage:LOW). They all use units of volts.

l

The instrument uses the current units selection for both front panel and remote interface operations.
For example, if you select "VRMS" from the remote interface (VOLTage:UNIT VRMS), the units are displayed as "VRMS" on the front panel.

l

Command applies to VOLTage? query results.

l

Output units for amplitude cannot be set to dBm if the output termination is set to "high impedance."
The units are automatically converted to Vpp.

l

Arbitrary waveform sequences do not accept units of Vrms or dBm.

l

Unless you specify the units as part of either the VOLTage command or one of the APPLy commands,
the VOLTage:UNIT command takes precedence. For example, if you select VOLTage:UNIT VRMS and
do not include units with an APPLy command, the <amplitude> in the APPLy command will be in
"Vrms".

Configure an arbitrary waveform
This section describes the configuration of an arbitrary waveform.
Description
A user-created arbitrary waveform has amplitude, offset, sample rate, and filter type. These can be set
when the arbitrary waveform file (.arb or .barb extension) is loaded into waveform memory. The beginning of a typical arbitrary waveform is shown below; note that amplitude and offset are represented by
high and low voltage values:
File Format:1.10
Checksum:0
Channel Count:1
Sample Rate:20000.000000
High Level:2.000000

Data Points:100
Data:

23114
The 23259 and 23114 lines after the Data: line are ASCII DAC codes representing the first two waveform
data values. If the waveform's DAC codes do not range from -32767 to + 32767, the output amplitude is
asymmetric.
In firmware revisions 1.12 and before, the instrument did not update waveform metadata (sample rate,
voltage range, and filter setting) when switching from one arbitrary waveform to another. The new arbitrary waveform adopted the metadata of the waveform already in memory. Therefore, an arbitrary waveform designed to play at one voltage range, sample rate, and filter setting (as specified in the waveform’s
metadata) was changed to another set of metadata. After firmware revision 1.12, arbitrary waveforms
load any metadata present in the arbitrary waveform file, so that they play the way they previously
played.
Built-in waveforms make few or no changes when loaded into waveform memory. They play according to
the instrument’s current configuration. For example, see the beginning of Haversine.arb, shown below.

The instrument uses LAN port 5024 for SCPI Telnet sessions,
and port 5025 for SCPI Socket sessions.

SCPI Error Messages
The instrument returns error messages in accord with the SCPI standard.
l

Up to 20 command syntax or hardware errors can be stored in each interface-specific error queue
(one each for GPIB, USB, VXI-11, and Telnet/Sockets.) Errors appear in the error queue of the I/O session that caused the error.

l

The instrument beeps once each time an error is generated (unless disabled by SYSTem:BEEPer:STATe OFF). The front panel ERROR annunciator turns on when one or more errors are in the error
queue.

l

A special global error queue holds all power-on and hardware-related errors (for example, overtemperature).

l

Error retrieval is first-in-first-out (FIFO), and errors are cleared as you read them. Once you have read
all interface-specific errors, the errors in the global error queue are retrieved. When you have read all
errors from the global error queue, the ERROR annunciator turns off.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

454

l

If more than 20 errors have occurred, the last error stored in the queue (the most recent error) is
replaced with -350,"Error queue overflow". No additional errors are stored until you remove errors
from the queue. If no errors have occurred when you read the error queue, the instrument responds
with +0,"No error".

l

The front panel reports errors from all I/O sessions and the global error queue. To read the error
queue from the front panel, press the [System] button, then the Help softkey. Then select "View
remote command error queue" in the Help menu.

l

Error conditions are also summarized in the Status Byte Register. See Status Subsystem Introduction
for details

l

The interface-specific error queues are cleared by power cycles and *CLS. The error queue is not
cleared by *RST.

Obtaining Repair Service (Worldwide)
To obtain service for your instrument, contact your nearest Keysight Technologies Service Center. They
will arrange to have your unit repaired or replaced, and can provide warranty or repair–cost information
where applicable. Ask the Keysight Technologies Service Center for shipping instructions, including what
components to ship. Keysight recommends that you retain the original shipping carton for return shipments.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

470

Service and Repair - Introduction

Repackaging for Shipment
To ship the unit to Keysight for service or repair:
l

Attach a tag to the unit identifying the owner and indicating the required service or repair. Include the
model number and full serial number.

l

Place the unit in its original container with appropriate packaging material.

l

Secure the container with strong tape or metal bands.

l

If the original shipping container is unavailable, use a container that will ensure at least 10 cm (4 in.)
of compressible packaging material around the entire instrument. Use static-free packaging materials.

Keysight suggests that you always insure shipments.

Cleaning
Clean the outside of the instrument with a soft, lint-free cloth slightly dampened with water only. Do not
use detergent or any form of spray. Disassembly is not required or recommended for cleaning.

Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Precautions
Almost all electrical components can be damaged by electrostatic discharge (ESD) during handling. Component damage can occur at electrostatic discharge voltages as low as 50 V.
The following guidelines will help prevent ESD damage during service operations:
l

Disassemble instruments only in a static-free work area.

l

Use a conductive work area to reduce static charges.

l

Use a conductive wrist strap to reduce static charge accumulation.

l

Minimize handling.

l

Keep replacement parts in original static-free packaging.

l

Remove all plastic, foam, vinyl, paper, and other static-generating materials from the immediate work
area.

l

Use only anti-static solder suckers.

Introduction to Calibration - 33500 Series
This chapter contains procedures for verifying the instrument's performance and adjustment (calibration).
The instrument uses closed-case electronic calibration; no internal mechanical adjustments are required.
The instrument calculates correction factors based on input reference values that you set and stores correction factors in non-volatile memory until the next calibration adjustment is performed. This data is not
changed by cycling power or *RST.

Keysight Technologies Calibration Services
Your local Keysight Technologies Service Center offers low-cost recalibration. The service center uses
automated calibration systems that allow Keysight to provide calibration at competitive prices.

Service and Repair - Introduction

Calibration Overview - 33500 Series
This section introduces the instrument's calibration features. For more detailed calibration information,
see Introduction to Calibration.
Calibration Interval
The instrument should be calibrated on a regular interval determined by the accuracy requirements of
your application. A one-year interval is adequate for most applications. Accuracy specifications are warranted only if adjustment is made at regular calibration intervals. Accuracy specifications are not warranted beyond the one-year calibration interval. Keysight Technologies does not recommend calibration
intervals beyond two years for any application.
Adjustment is Recommended
Whatever calibration interval you select, Keysight Technologies recommends that complete re-adjustment should always be performed at the calibration interval. This ensures that the instrument will remain
within specifications for the next calibration interval and provides the best long-term stability. Performance data measured using this method can be used to extend future calibration intervals. Use the Calibration Count to verify that all adjustments have been performed.
Time Required for Calibration
For incoming instrument verification, do performance verification tests first. Then perform adjustments
and re-run the performance verification tests. Each of these steps, if done manually, takes approximately
30 minutes per channel to perform.
The instrument can also be automatically calibrated under computer control. With computer control you
can perform the complete calibration procedure and performance verification tests in approximately 30
minutes (one channel) or 60 minutes (two channels) once the instrument is warmed-up (see Test Considerations).
Automating Calibration Procedures
You can use programmable test equipment to automate the complete verification and adjustment procedures. You can program each test's instrument configuration over the remote interface. Then enter
read-back verification data into a test program and compare the results to the appropriate test limit.
You can also adjust the instrument from the remote interface, which is similar to the front panel procedure. Use a computer to perform the adjustment by first selecting the required function and range on
the measurement equipment. Send the calibration value to the instrument and then initiate calibration
over the remote interface.
You must unsecure the instrument before calibration.
A typical programming sequence for a single calibration setup is as follows:
1. CAL:SETup 2 (configures instrument for calibration step 2)
2. Measure the output frequency with the external frequency counter
3. CAL:VALue 9.99994321E6 (send the measured value to the instrument)

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

474

Service and Repair - Introduction
4. CAL? (initiates the calibration adjustment for setup 2)
5. Read CAL? query value to determine the failure (+1) or success (+0) of adjustment
6. CAL:SETup 3 (configures instrument for calibration step 3)
For further information on instrument programming, see Introduction to SCPI Language.
Recommended Test Equipment
The test equipment recommended for the performance verification and adjustment procedures is listed
below. If the exact instrument is not available, substitute calibration standards of equivalent accuracy.

Test Considerations
For optimal performance, all procedures should comply with the following recommendations:
l

Calibration ambient temperature is stable, between 18 and 28 °C. Ideally, it should be 23 ±1 °C.

l

Ambient relative humidity is less than 80%.

l

One-hour warm-up period before verification or adjustment.

l

Measurement cables as short as possible, consistent with the impedance requirements.

l

RG-58 or equivalent 50 Ω cable.

Calibration Count
You can query the instrument to determine how many calibrations have been performed. The instrument
was calibrated at the factory. When you receive your instrument, be sure to read the count to determine
its initial value.
l

This setting is non-volatile; it will not be changed by power cycling or *RST.

Because the value increments for each calibration point that stores a value, a complete calibration
increases the value by many counts.

Calibration Message
You can store one message of up to 40 characters in calibration memory. For example, you can store the
date when the last calibration was performed, the date when the next calibration is due, the instrument's
serial number, or contact information for your calibration experts.
Unsecure the instrument to record a calibration message. You can read the message from either the front
panel or over the remote interface, regardless of whether the instrument is secured.

This section describes the instrument's calibration security system.
Security Overview
A security code prevents accidental or unauthorized instrument adjustments. On the 33500 Series, the
factory default security code varies by model:
Models

Security Code

33521A and 33522A

AT33520A

335XXB

l

Once you enter a security code, that code must be used for both front panel and remote operation. If
you secure the instrument from the front panel, you must use that same code to unsecure it from the
remote interface.

l

This setting is non-volatile; it will not be changed by power cycling or *RST.

3. Apply a temporary short between pin 1 and pin 6 of the header on the main board, shown below.

4. Attach power and turn on the instrument.
Be careful not to touch the power line connections or high voltages on the power supply module. Power is present even if the instrument is turned off.
5. The error queue will show the message "Calibration security has been disabled."
Calibration security is unlocked, with password reset to its factory default value. Calibration count is
incremented because jumper was connected during power-up, and error message +701,"Calibration
error; security defeated by hardware jumper" is issued. Nonvolatile calibration storage is updated to
reflect these operations.
6. Turn off the instrument, remove temporary short, and remove power cord.
7. Reassemble the instrument.
8. Enter a new security code as described above, and record the security code in a safe location.

Performance Verification Tests - 33500 Series
Use the Performance Verification Tests to verify the measurement performance of the instrument. The performance verification tests use the instrument’s specifications listed on the product datasheet.
You can perform three levels of performance verification tests:
l

Self-Test A series of internal verification tests that give high confidence that the instrument is operational.

l

Quick Verification A combination of the internal self-tests and selected verification tests.

l

Performance Verification Tests An extensive set of tests that are recommended as an acceptance
test when you first receive the instrument or after performing adjustments.

Self-Test
A brief power-on self-test occurs automatically whenever you turn on the instrument. This limited test
assures that the instrument is operational. For details, see Self-Test Procedures.
Quick Performance Check
The quick performance check is a combination of internal self-test and an abbreviated performance test
(specified by the letter Q in the performance verification tests). This test provides a simple method to
achieve high confidence in the instrument's ability to functionally operate and meet specifications. These
tests represent the absolute minimum set of performance checks recommended following any service
activity. Auditing the instrument’s performance for the quick check points (designated by a Q) verifies performance for normal accuracy drift mechanisms. This test does not check for abnormal component failures.
To perform the quick performance check, do the following:
1. Perform a complete self-test.
2. Perform only the performance verification tests indicated with the letter Q.

479

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Service and Repair - Introduction
3. If the instrument fails the quick performance check, adjustment or repair is required.
Performance Verification Tests
The performance verification tests are recommended as acceptance tests when you first receive the
instrument. The acceptance test results should be compared against the specifications on the product
datasheet. After acceptance, you should repeat the performance verification tests at every calibration
interval.
If the instrument fails performance verification, adjustment or repair is required.
Adjustment is recommended at every calibration interval. If adjustment is not made, you must guard
band, using no more than 80% of the specifications listed in the datasheet, as the verification limits.
Amplitude and Flatness Verification Procedures
The flatness verification procedures use a precision AC voltmeter and a power meter. You may substitute
Thermal Voltage Converters (TVCs) to make measurements using appropriate operating procedures and
test equipment.
Flatness measurements for the -24 dB and -8 dB attenuator ranges are measured during the verification
procedure. Other attenuator ranges are verified as a part of -24 dB and -8 dB attenuation range verification procedures. No separate verification procedure is given for these ranges.

This chapter contains procedures for verifying the instrument's performance and adjustment (calibration).
The instrument uses closed-case electronic calibration; no internal mechanical adjustments are required.
The instrument calculates correction factors based on input reference values that you set and stores correction factors in non-volatile memory until the next calibration adjustment is performed. This data is not
changed by cycling power or *RST.

Calibration Overview - 33600 Series
This section introduces the instrument's calibration features. For more detailed calibration information,
see Introduction to Calibration.
Calibration Interval
The instrument should be calibrated on a regular interval determined by the accuracy requirements of
your application. A one-year interval is adequate for most applications. Accuracy specifications are warranted only if adjustment is made at regular calibration intervals. Accuracy specifications are not war-

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

508

Service and Repair - Introduction
ranted beyond the one-year calibration interval. Keysight Technologies does not recommend calibration
intervals beyond two years for any application.
Adjustment is Recommended
Whatever calibration interval you select, Keysight Technologies recommends that complete re-adjustment should always be performed at the calibration interval. This ensures that the instrument will remain
within specifications for the next calibration interval and provides the best long-term stability. Performance data measured using this method can be used to extend future calibration intervals. Use the Calibration Count to verify that all adjustments have been performed.
Time Required for Calibration
For incoming instrument verification, do performance verification tests first. Then perform adjustments
and re-run the performance verification tests. Each of these steps, if done manually, takes approximately
30 minutes per channel to perform.
The instrument can also be automatically calibrated under computer control. With computer control you
can perform the complete calibration procedure and performance verification tests in approximately 30
minutes (one channel) or 60 minutes (two channels) once the instrument is warmed-up (see Test Considerations).
Automating Calibration Procedures
You can use programmable test equipment to automate the complete verification and adjustment procedures. You can program each test's instrument configuration over the remote interface. Then enter
read-back verification data into a test program and compare the results to the appropriate test limit.
You can also adjust the instrument from the remote interface, which is similar to the front panel procedure. Use a computer to perform the adjustment by first selecting the required function and range on
the measurement equipment. Send the calibration value to the instrument and then initiate calibration
over the remote interface.
You must unsecure the instrument before calibration.
A typical programming sequence for a single calibration setup is as follows:
1. CAL:SETup 2 (configures instrument for calibration step 2)
2. Measure the output frequency with the external frequency counter
3. CAL:VALue 9.99994321E6 (send the measured value to the instrument)
4. CAL? (initiates the calibration adjustment for setup 2)
5. Read CAL? query value to determine the failure (+1) or success (+0) of adjustment
6. CAL:SETup 3 (configures instrument for calibration step 3)
For further information on instrument programming, see Introduction to SCPI Language.

Performance Verification Tests - 33600 Series
Use the Performance Verification Tests to verify the measurement performance of the instrument. The performance verification tests use the instrument’s specifications listed on the product datasheet.
You can perform three levels of performance verification tests:
l

Self-Test A series of internal verification tests that give high confidence that the instrument is operational.

l

Quick Verification A combination of the internal self-tests and selected verification tests.

l

Performance Verification Tests An extensive set of tests that are recommended as an acceptance
test when you first receive the instrument or after performing adjustments.

Self-Test
A brief power-on self-test occurs automatically whenever you turn on the instrument. This limited test
assures that the instrument is operational. For details, see Self-Test Procedures.
Quick Performance Check
The quick performance check is a combination of internal self-test and an abbreviated performance test
(specified by the letter Q in the performance verification tests). This test provides a simple method to
achieve high confidence in the instrument's ability to functionally operate and meet specifications. These
tests represent the absolute minimum set of performance checks recommended following any service
activity. Auditing the instrument’s performance for the quick check points (designated by a Q) verifies performance for normal accuracy drift mechanisms. This test does not check for abnormal component failures.
To perform the quick performance check, do the following:
1. Perform a complete self-test.
2. Perform only the performance verification tests indicated with the letter Q.
3. If the instrument fails the quick performance check, adjustment or repair is required.
Performance Verification Tests
The performance verification tests are recommended as acceptance tests when you first receive the
instrument. The acceptance test results should be compared against the specifications on the product
datasheet. After acceptance, you should repeat the performance verification tests at every calibration
interval.
If the instrument fails performance verification, adjustment or repair is required.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

514

Service and Repair - Introduction
Adjustment is recommended at every calibration interval. If adjustment is not made, you must guard
band, using no more than 80% of the specifications listed in the datasheet, as the verification limits.
Amplitude and Flatness Verification Procedures
The flatness verification procedures use a precision AC voltmeter and a power meter. You may substitute
Thermal Voltage Converters (TVCs) to make measurements using appropriate operating procedures and
test equipment.
The Fluke 5790A precision AC voltmeter is used to measure the amplitude from 1 kHz to 20 MHz. From 20
to 120 MHz, a power meter with the Keysight N8482A power sensor is used. Measurements of amplitudes
from both the 5790A and the N8482A at 1 MHz to 20 MHz are used to scale the N8482A to the 5790A.

Aborting a Calibration in Progress - 33600 Series
Sometimes it may be necessary to abort a calibration in progress. You can abort a calibration at any time
by turning off the power or by issuing a remote interface device clear message followed by *RST.
The instrument stores calibration constants at the end of each adjustment procedure. If you lose power,
or otherwise abort an adjustment in progress, you will only need to perform the interrupted adjustment
procedure again.
If power is lost when the instrument is attempting to write new calibration constants to
memory, you may lose all calibration constants for the function. Typically, upon reapplying power, the instrument will report error "-313, Calibration Memory Lost".

A simplified block diagram appears at the bottom of this section.
The processor is a single board computer that contains the CPU, RAM, ROM, and circuits used to drive
the GPIB, LAN, and USB ports. The built in web interface is contained in the ROM. The processor circuitry
is earth referenced.
When the power switch is pressed, the processor communicates with and loads the FPGA. This communication uses three asynchronous serial data lines and one serial clock line. These four lines are isolated.
The FPGA stores all waveforms except arbitrary waveforms. Arbitrary waveforms are loaded into SDRAM
on the main board. All control of waveforms, triggers, sync signals, output path, attenuation, and offset is
provided by the FPGA.
The main waveform for each channel (only one channel is shown in the block diagram) is loaded into the
waveform DAC and clocked by the timebase. The DAC output passes through an elliptical filter before the
main attenuators. There are three attenuators available in the path, -7.96 dB, -15.91 dB, and -23.87 dB.
The signal is applied to the output amplifier. The DC offset is summed at the output amplifier. A post amplifier -23.87 dB attenuator is available for low level signals. The table below show the attenuators that create the output signal amplitude.

The output relay when enabled provides the waveform to the front panel BNC connector. Additionally,
this relay, when disabled, routes the signal to the Modulation ADC for internal self-test and calibration
routines.
The output relay is controlled by the FPGA. Two circuits provide overvoltage and over current protection,
primarily from an external circuit. The instrument can source very low output impedances.
The Sync output signal is generated as a waveform from the FPGA to the Sync DAC.
External trigger in and out is chassis referenced at the BNC connector but is isolated before the FPGA.
Modulation in is an isolated input to the A/D converter. The FPGA applies the modulation signal to the output waveform.

Self-Test Errors 605 - 609
Self-test errors 605-609 indicate that the processor board is unable to correctly program or communicate
with the waveform FPGA (U1005) on the main board. In this case, further troubleshooting is required. The
problem could be due to out of date firmware, or a failing or unseated processor board or main board.
Before troubleshooting these errors, ensure that the instrument firmware is up to date. If the errors are
still being reported, continue with the following procedure.
Reseat the Boards
Power off the unit, remove the cover. Reseat the processor board and the main board. Power up the unit
and see if the errors 605-609 are still reported at power-on.

Service and Repair - Introduction
Check Power Supplies
Probe the system power supplies and verify they are operating within limits. If any of the power supplies
are out of limit, diagnose the power supply. Otherwise, continue on to check SPI communications.
Check SPI Communications
If you still see errors after reseating the boards, the next step is to probe the SPI communications lines
between the processor board and the main board. First, locate LED DS1001 on the main board as shown
below. Cycle power on the unit, wait until it fully boots, and see whether the main board LED illuminates.
The main board LED indicates whether the FPGA was successfully programmed. The following sections
indicate which signal lines to probe on the main board connector (J201).

Main Board LED Lights up after Boot
This indicates that the FPGA is programmed and running. Most likely there is a communications failure
from the main board to the processor board. Probe the J201, pin 27 line with an oscilloscope, and cycle
power on the unit (wait for full boot) to see if there is activity on the line. Activity should be +3.3 V pulses
(isolated). Note that activity ceases once the instrument is booted.
l

If there is no activity on the line even after the LED lights up, then most likely the main board is the
cause of the failure.

l

If there is activity on the line, then the processor board is the most likely cause of the failure.

565

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Service and Repair - Introduction

Main Board LED Does not Light up after Boot
This indicates that the processor was unable to program the FPGA. Most likely there is a communications
failure from the processor board to the main board. Probe the following serial data lines at power up with
an oscilloscope:
l

J201, pin 23

l

J201, pin 24

l

J201, pin 26

l

J201, pin 32

If all of the above SPI lines show activity during FPGA programming, then the main board is the most
likely cause of the failure. Otherwise, the processor board is the most likely cause.

10 MHz Out
If the power supplies are functional and self-test passes, check the 10 MHz output at the rear panel. This
output is present whenever the instrument has powered on and the processor and main board are operational. If the 10 MHz is present, but the display is not working, suspect the front panel board or display
assembly.

Self-Test Errors 607 through 611
Self-test errors 607-611 indicate that the processor board is unable to correctly program or communicate
with the waveform FPGA (U301) on the mezzanine board. In this case, further troubleshooting is required.
The problem could be due to out of date firmware, or a failing or unseated processor board or main board.
Before troubleshooting these errors, ensure that the instrument firmware is up to date. If the errors are
still reported, continue with the following procedure.
Reseat the Boards
Power off the unit and remove the cover. Reseat the mezzanine board and the main board. Power up the
unit and see whether errors 607 through 611 are still reported. Check all power good LEDs to see if the
power supplies are operating. Not all power supplies have an LED.
Check SPI Communications
If you still see self-test errors after reseating the boards, the next step is to probe the SPI communications
lines between the processor board and the main board. First, locate LED DS1501 on the mezzanine board
as shown above. Cycle power on the unit, wait until it fully boots, and see whether the main board "power
good" LEDs (DS2001, DS2002) illuminate. Check whether the mezzanine board "power good" LED
DS1501 illuminates, indicating the mezzanine board power supplies are good.

Check FPGA programming success
The DS401 LED on the mezzanine board (to the left of DS1501 in the picture above) indicates whether the
FPGA was successfully programmed. If illuminated, it indicates that the FPGA is programmed and running. If it fails to light and all power supplies are good, most likely there is a SPI communications failure
from the processor board to the main board or from the main board to the mezzanine board.
Check SPI Communications
Probe the front panel to main board connector J201 pins 23, 24, 26 and 27 to check for activity during
bootup between the main board and the front panel board. Activity should be +3.3 V pulses (isolated).
Note that activity ceases or becomes infrequent once the instrument is booted. If there is no activity, the
fault most likely lies in the front panel board.

Service and Repair - Introduction
Probe the Opto isolator U602 pin 6 on the main board with an oscilloscope, and cycle power on the unit
(wait for full boot) to see if there is activity on the line. This line is used to reset the FPGA to initiate programming. Activity should be +3.3 V pulses (isolated).
Also check U601 (on the main board) pins 11, 12, 13, and 14 for activity during bootup. Note that activity
ceases or becomes infrequent once the instrument is booted.
If there is no activity, the fault most likely lies in the main board.
If there is activity and the DS401 LED does not light, the fault most likely lies in the mezzanine board.

10 MHz Out
If the power supplies are functional and self-test passes, check the 10 MHz output at the rear panel. This
output is present whenever the instrument has powered on and the processor and main board are operational. If the 10 MHz is present, but the display is not working, suspect the front panel board or display
assembly.

Self-Test Procedures
Power-On Self-Test
Each time the instrument is powered on, self-tests are performed to check that the minimum set of logic
and subsystems are functioning properly.

571

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Service and Repair - Introduction

Full Self-Test
Passing self-test provides a high degree of confidence that instrument is operating normally. Self-test
procedure systematically exercises internal oscillator, digital infrastructure, waveform memory, and analog attenuator paths. It attempts to isolate failures to a particular assembly to facilitate service. During
the test, instrument main output(s) are disconnected internally from the BNC connectors and are connected to the internal ADC, which checks for expected signal levels throughout the instrument.
A complete self-test (*TST?) takes approximately 15 seconds. You may hear relays switching during the
procedure. When self-test completes, either "Self-test Passed" or "Self-test Failed" appears on the front
panel. Self-test error messages are described in detail below.
Execute self-test before any verifications or adjustments.

To Run Self-Test
Remove all input connections to instrument before self-test. Cycle power to run power-on self-test.
Remote I/O Execution
1. Connect to instrument using remote interface (LAN Configuration Procedure).
2. Send *TST? and read the result: Pass (+0) or fail (+1). Use SYSTem:ERRor? to view errors.
Front Panel Execution
1. Press [System] > Instr Setup > Self Test.
2. A progress bar will appear as self-test executes. After completion, view any failures by pressing [System] > Help and then choosing the topic View remote command error queue.

Consignes d'utilisation

Présentation succincte de la face avant
Les connecteurs BNC (boîtier et broche centrale) situés sur la face avant de l'instrument
sont isolés jusqu'à ±42 V crête du châssis. Les boîtiers de ces connecteurs BNC sont
connectés les uns aux autres et la circuiterie interne tentera de maintenir la tension isolée
dans les limites de ±42 V crête par rapport au châssis. Tout dépassement de la tension
d'isolation au-delà de ±42 V crête du châssis peut détruire l'instrument et provoquer des
risques de blessures graves, voire mortelles.

Connecteur de réseau local (LAN)

Le connecteur BNC d'entrée de référence 10 MHz situé sur la face arrière de l'instrument
est isolé jusqu'à ±42 V crête du châssis. Le boîtier de ce connecteur BNC est isolé du reste
de l'instrument. La circuiterie interne tentera de maintenir la tension isolée dans les
limites de ±42 V crête par rapport au châssis. Toute tentative de configuration de cette
entrée au-delà de ±42 V crête du châssis peut détruire l'instrument et provoquer des
risques de blessures graves, voire mortelles.

Le connecteur BNC d'entrée de modulation externe (boîtier et broche centrale) situé sur la
face arrière de l'instrument est isolé jusqu'à ±42 V crête du châssis. Le boîtier de ce
connecteur BNC est relié aux boîtiers des connecteurs BNC de la face arrière. La circuiterie
interne tentera de maintenir la tension isolée dans les limites de ±42 V crête par rapport
au châssis. Toute tentative de configuration des tensions de sortie flottantes au-delà
de ±42 V crête du châssis peut détruire l'instrument et provoquer des risques de blessures graves, voire mortelles.

Ceci est un équipement de protection de classe 1 (le châssis doit être connecté à une prise de
terre). La prise principale doit être insérée uniquement dans une prise munie d'une borne de
terre de protection.

l'option GPIB est installée et activée.

Interrupteur d'alimentation :

La fonction par défaut de l'instrument est un signal sinusoïdal de 1 kHz / 100 mVpp (dans une terminaison de 50 Ω). À la mise sous tension, les connecteurs de sortie des voies sont désactivés. Pour activer la sortie sur le connecteur d'une voie, appuyez sur la touche au-dessus du connecteur et appuyez sur
la touche de fonction Output Off / On.
Si l'instrument ne s'allume pas, vérifiez que le cordon d'alimentation est solidement branché. Vérifiez également que l'instrument est connecté à une source d'alimentation sous tension. Si le voyant situé sous
l'interrupteur d'alimentation est éteint, la tension secteur est absente. Si le voyant est orange,
l'instrument est alimenté en courant secteur et en veille ; s'il est vert, l'instrument est en service.
Si le test échoue à la mise sous tension, l'écran affiche ERR dans l'angle supérieur droit. Il affiche également « Check for error messages in the error queue ».
Pour de plus amples informations sur les codes d'erreur, reportez-vous à la section Messages d'erreur
SCPI. Pour des instructions détaillées sur le retour de l'instrument pour entretien, reportez-vous à la section Présentation des opérations d'entretien et de réparation.
Pour mettre l'instrument hors tension, maintenez l'interrupteur d'alimentation enfoncé pendant environ
500 ms. Cela évite d'éteindre l'instrument en appuyant accidentellement sur l'interrupteur.

Envoi d'un signal PWM
Vous pouvez configurer l'instrument pour envoyer un signal PWM (modulation de la largeur d'impulsion).
La modulation PWM est disponible uniquement pour un train d'impulsions ; la largeur d'impulsion varie
en fonction du signal modulant. L'importance de variation d'une largeur d'impulsion est appelée variation
de largeur ; elle peut être spécifiée en pourcentage de la période du signal (rapport cyclique) ou en unité
de temps. Par exemple, si vous spécifiez une impulsion avec un rapport cyclique de 20 % et activez
ensuite la modulation PWM avec une variation de 5 %, le rapport cyclique varie entre 15 % et 25 % sous
le contrôle du signal modulant.
Pour modifier la largeur d'impulsion en rapport cyclique d'impulsion, appuyez sur [Units].
Dans cet exemple, vous spécifiez une largeur d'impulsion et une variation de la largeur d'impulsion pour

Procédure de configuration du réseau local
Plusieurs paramètres peuvent être nécessaires pour établir les communications au moyen de l'interface
de réseau local. Vous devez d'abord configurer une adresse IP. Vous devrez peut-être contacter votre
administrateur réseau qui vous aidera à établir les communications avec l'interface du réseau local.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Consignes d'utilisation
1. Sélectionnez le menu « I/O ».
Appuyez sur [System] > I/O Config.
2. Sélectionnez le menu LAN Settings.
Appuyez sur la touche de fonction LAN Settings.
Vous pouvez sélectionner Modify Settings pour modifier les réglages du réseau local, ou bien activer/désactiver l'option LAN Services ou rétablir les paramètres réseau par défaut.

Cet écran reflète l'affichage de la série 33500. La série 33600 inclut également un
voyant d'état LAN Status dans l'angle supérieur droit pour indiquer si la connexion
LAN est satisfaisante ou défaillante.

3. Appuyez sur Modify Settings.

Pour accéder à la plupart des paramètres de cet écran, utilisez la première touche de fonction pour
basculer de DHCP vers Manual. Si l'option DHCP est activée, une adresse IP est automatiquement
configurée par DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) lorsque vous connectez l'instrument au
réseau, si le serveur DHCP existe et peut effectuer cette opération. Le protocole DHCP se charge également du masque de sous-réseau et de l'adresse de la passerelle si nécessaire. Il s'agit de la manière
la plus facile d'établir les communications avec le réseau local pour votre instrument. Il vous suffit de
laisser l'option DHCP activée. Pour plus d'informations, contactez votre administrateur réseau.

Consignes d'utilisation
4. Spécifiez une « Configuration IP ».
Si vous n'utilisez pas l'option DHCP (première touche de fonction sur Manuel), vous devez spécifier
une configuration IP, y compris une adresse IP, et éventuellement un masque de sous-réseau et
l'adresse d'une passerelle. Les boutons IP Address et Subnet Mask sont situés sur l'écran principal.
Appuyez sur More pour configurer la passerelle.

Contactez votre administrateur réseau pour obtenir l'adresse IP, le masque de sous-réseau et la passerelle à utiliser. Toutes les adresses IP sont exprimées sous la forme « nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn », où « nnn »
est la valeur décimale d'un octet de 0 à 255. Vous pouvez entrer une nouvelle adresse IP sur le clavier
numérique (et non avec le bouton). Tapez simplement les nombres et les points de séparation à l'aide
du clavier. Utilisez le curseur de gauche comme touche de retour arrière. Ne saisissez pas de zéro au
début des nombres.
5. Spécifiez la « DNS Setup » (facultatif)
DNS (Domain Name Service) est un service Internet qui traduit les noms de domaines en adresses IP.
Demandez à votre administrateur réseau si ce service est utilisé ; si tel est le cas, demandez le nom
d'hôte, le nom du domaine et l'adresse du serveur à utiliser.
a. Définissez le nom d'hôte (hostname). Appuyez sur Host Name et entrez le nom d'hôte. Un nom
d'hôte est la partie concernant l'hôte dans le nom du domaine qui est traduite en adresse IP. Vous
entrez le nom d'hôte sous forme d'une chaîne de caractères au moyen du bouton et des touches
de curseur pour sélectionner et modifier les caractères. Le nom d'hôte peut contenir des lettres,
des chiffres et des tirets (« - »). Vous pouvez utiliser le clavier uniquement pour les chiffres.

b. Définissez les adresses des serveurs DNS. Dans l'écran de configuration du réseau, appuyez sur
More pour accéder au deuxième ensemble de touches de fonction.

Entrez les serveurs DNS principal et secondaire. Pour plus d'informations, consultez votre administrateur réseau.
En savoir plus sur les adresses IP et la notation par points
Les adresses notées par points (« nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn », où « nnn » représente la valeur d'un octet comprise
entre 0 et 255) doivent être exprimées avec soin du fait que la plupart des logiciels des PC interprètent les
octets avec des zéros initiaux comme des nombres en base 8. Par exemple, « 192.168.020.011 » est équivalent à la notation décimale « 192.168.16.9 », car « .020 » est interprété comme « 16 » en base 8 et « .011
» comme « 9 ». Pour éviter toute confusion, utilisez uniquement des valeurs décimales comprises entre 0
et 255 sans zéro au début.

Configuration d'un signal arbitraire
L'instrument comprend un éditeur de signaux intégré qui permet de créer et de modifier des signaux arbitraires. Vous pouvez créer ces signaux en modifiant directement des tensions ou en utilisant une combinaison de 12 types de signaux standard différents maximum.
Ce didacticiel crée et modifie un signal ordinaire.

Limitations concernant la fréquence : Toute modification d'une fonction peut se répercuter sur la fréquence afin de correspondre aux limites fréquentielles de la nouvelle fonction.
Limitations concernant l'amplitude : Lorsque l'unité de sortie est Vrms ou dBm, la modification de
fonctions peut diminuer l'amplitude au minimum pour la nouvelle fonction du fait d'une variation des
formes de signaux. Par exemple, un signal carré de 5 Veff (dans une impédance de 50 Ω) remplacé
par un signal sinusoïdal diminue l'amplitude à 3,536 Veff (limite supérieure du signal sinusoïdal).
Il n'est pas possible de combiner l'amplitude et la tension résiduelle pour dépasser les caractéristiques limites de l'instrument. Il est possible de modifier la dernière configuration afin de rester
dans les limites.

Limitations concernant la fréquence : Toute modification d'une fonction peut se répercuter sur la fréquence afin de correspondre aux limites fréquentielles de la nouvelle fonction. Les signaux arbitraires
conservent leur dernier paramètre de fréquence.
Limitations sur les rafales : Pour les rafales déclenchées en interne, la fréquence minimale est de 126
µHz.
Limitations sur le rapport cyclique : Pour les signaux carrés et les impulsions sur la série 33500, le rapport cyclique est limité par la largeur minimale des impulsions spécifiée de 16 ns. Par exemple, à
1 kHz, il est possible de définir un rapport cyclique aussi faible que 0,01 % du fait que cela implique
une largeur d'impulsion de 100 ns. À 1 MHz, le rapport cyclique est de 1,6 % et à 10 MHz, il est de
16 %. Toute modification à une fréquence qui ne génère pas le rapport cyclique actuel entraîne un
ajustement du rapport cyclique pour remplir la condition de largeur minimale des impulsions.
Sur la série 33500, la largeur d'impulsion minimale est de 16 ns. Sur la série 33600, la largeur
d'impulsion minimale est de 5 ns jusqu'à 4 Vpp et de 8 ns jusqu'à 10 Vpp.

Amplitude de sortie
L'amplitude par défaut est de 100 mVpp (dans une impédance de 50 Ω) pour toutes les fonctions.
l

Limitations de la tension résiduelle : La relation entre l'amplitude et la tension résiduelle est indiquée
ci-dessous. Vmax est de ±5 V pour une charge de 50 Ω ou de ±10 V pour une charge de haute impédance.
Vpp < 2(Vmax – |Voffset|)

89

Limites imposées par l'impédance de sortie : Si l'amplitude est de 10 Vpp et si vous modifiez la terminaison de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance » (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF), l'amplitude double pour
atteindre 20 Vpp. Toute modification de la « haute impédance » à 50 Ω réduit de moitié l'amplitude
affichée. L'impédance de sortie n'affecte pas la tension de sortie réelle. Elle modifie uniquement les
valeurs affichées et récupérées de l'interface distante. La tension de sortie réelle varie en fonction de
la charge connectée.
Limites imposées par la sélection de l'unité : Les limites d'amplitude sont parfois déterminées par
l'unité de sortie sélectionnée. Cela peut se produire lorsque l'unité est Veff ou dBm en raison des différences entre les facteurs de crête de diverses fonctions. Par exemple, si vous modifiez un signal
carré 5 Vrms (dans une charge de 50 Ω) en signal sinusoïdal, l'instrument ajuste l'amplitude à 3,536
Veff (limite maximale Vrms pour un signal sinusoïdal). L'interface distante génère également une
erreur de conflit des paramètres.
Vous pouvez exprimer l'amplitude en Vpp, Veff ou dBm. Vous ne pouvez pas spécifier l'amplitude de
sortie en dBm si la terminaison de sortie est réglée sur une impédance élevée. Pour plus
d'informations, reportez-vous à la section Unités de sortie.
Limitations concernant les signaux arbitraires : Pour les signaux arbitraires, l'amplitude est limitée si
les points du signal ne couvrent pas toute la plage du convertisseur N/A de sortie. Par exemple, le
signal intégré « Sinc » n'utilise pas la plage totale de valeurs ; son amplitude est donc limitée à 6,087
Vpp (dans une charge de 50 Ω).
La modification de l'amplitude peut interrompre brièvement la sortie à certaines tensions en raison de
la commutation de l'atténuateur de sortie. Néanmoins, l'amplitude est contrôlée de façon que la tension de sortie ne soit jamais supérieure au réglage actuel lorsque la commutation a lieu. Pour éviter
cette interruption, désactivez la détection automatique de la tension à l'aide de la commande VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO OFF. La commande APPLy active automatiquement la détection automatique.
La configuration des niveaux haut et bas entraîne également celle de l'amplitude et de la tension résiduelle du signal. Par exemple, si vous réglez le niveau haut sur +2 V et le niveau bas sur -3 V,
l'amplitude résultante est de 5 Vpp avec une tension résiduelle de -500 mV.
La tension résiduelle CC contrôle le niveau de sortie CC d'un signal. Le niveau de sortie CC peut être
compris entre ±5 V dans une charge de 50 Ω ou entre ±10 V avec une charge de haute impédance.

Tension CC résiduelle
La tension résiduelle par défaut est de 0 V pour toutes les fonctions.
l

l

Limites imposées par l'amplitude : Le rapport entre la tension résiduelle et l'amplitude de sortie est
illustré ci-dessous. La tension de sortie en crête (somme des tensions CC et CA) ne peut être supérieure aux caractéristiques nominales de l'instrument output rating (±5 V dans une charge de 50 Ω ou
±10 V dans un circuit ouvert).
Le rapport entre la tension résiduelle et l'amplitude de sortie est illustré ci-dessous. Vmax est la tension de crête maximale compte tenu de l'impédance de sortie déclarée (soit 50 V pour une charge de
50 Ω ou 10 V pour une charge haute impédance).
|Voffset| < Vmax - Vpp/2
Si la tension résiduelle saisie est incorrecte, l'instrument la règle au niveau maximal autorisé avec
l'amplitude spécifiée. Sur l'interface distante, l'erreur « Data out of range » est également générée.

Limites imposées par l'impédance de sortie : La plage de la tension résiduelle dépend de l'impédance
de sortie. Par exemple, si vous configurez une tension résiduelle de 100 mVcc et modifiez ensuite
l'impédance de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance », la tension résiduelle affichée sur la face avant
est multipliée par deux et passe à 200 mVcc (aucune erreur générée). Si vous passez de « haute impédance » à 50 Ω, la tension résiduelle affichée est divisée par deux. Pour plus d'informations, reportezvous à la commande OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD. La modification de l'impédance de sortie n’a aucune répercussion sur la tension aux bornes de sortie de l'instrument. Seules les valeurs affichées sur la face
avant et les valeurs demandées sur l'interface distante sont modifiées. La tension sur la sortie de
l'instrument dépend de la charge connectée à l'instrument. Pour plus d'informations, reportez-vous à
la commande OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD.
Limitations concernant les signaux arbitraires : Pour les signaux arbitraires, l'amplitude est limitée si
les points du signal ne couvrent pas toute la plage du convertisseur N/A de sortie. Par exemple, le
signal intégré « Sinc » n'utilise pas la plage totale de valeurs ; son amplitude est donc limitée à 6,087
Vpp (dans une charge de 50 Ω).
La configuration des niveaux haut et bas entraîne également celle de l'amplitude et de la tension résiduelle du signal. Par exemple, si vous réglez le niveau haut sur +2 V et le niveau bas sur -3 V,
l'amplitude résultante est de 5 Vpp avec une tension résiduelle de -500 mV.
Pour envoyer une tension continue, sélectionnez la fonction tension continue (CC - FUNCtion DC) et
réglez ensuite la tension résiduelle (VOLTage:OFFSet). Les valeurs acceptées sont comprises entre
±5 Vcc dans une charge de 50 Ω ou ±10 Vcc dans un circuit ouvert. Lorsque l'instrument est en
mode CC, le réglage de l'amplitude ne produit aucun effet.

Impédance de sortie
L'instrument comporte un ensemble constant d'impédances de sortie de 50 Ω sur les connecteurs de la
face avant. Si l'impédance de charge réelle diffère de la valeur spécifiée, l'amplitude et les niveaux de
décalage affichés seront incorrects. Le réglage de l'impédance de la charge est simplement un moyen pratique de garantir que la tension affichée correspond à la charge attendue.
l

l

l

Impédance de sortie : 1 Ω à 10 kΩ ou infinie. La valeur par défaut est 50 Ω. L'onglet au-dessus de
chaque voie indique la valeur de ce paramètre.

Si vous spécifiez une impédance de 50 Ω, mais effectuez en réalité la terminaison dans un circuit
ouvert, la sortie sera égale à 2 fois la valeur spécifiée. Par exemple, si vous configurez la tension résiduelle CC avec la valeur 100 mVcc (et spécifiez une charge de 50 Ω), mais effectuez la terminaison
dans un circuit ouvert, la tension résiduelle réelle sera de 200 mVcc.
Toute modification du réglage de l'impédance de sortie entraîne un ajustement de l'amplitude et la
tension résiduelle affichées (aucune erreur générée). Si l'amplitude est de 10 Vpp et si vous modifiez
la terminaison de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance » (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF), l'amplitude double
pour atteindre 20 Vpp. Toute modification de la « haute impédance » à 50 Ω réduit de moitié
l'amplitude affichée. L'impédance de sortie n'affecte pas la tension de sortie réelle. Elle modifie uniquement les valeurs affichées et récupérées de l'interface distante. La tension de sortie réelle varie en
fonction de la charge connectée.
La charge de sortie peut affecter la qualité du signal pour les fonctions d'impulsion et
autres avec des transitions à haute vitesse. Une résistance de charge élevée peut produire des réflexions.

l

l

L'unité est convertie en Vpp si l'impédance de sortie est une impédance élevée.
Vous ne pouvez pas modifier l'impédance de sortie lorsque les limites de tension sont actives du fait
que l'instrument ne peut pas savoir à quelle impédance ces limites s'appliquent. À la place, désactivez les limites de tension, configurez la nouvelle valeur d'impédance, ajustez les limites de tension
et réactivez-les.

Signal de sortie de synchronisation
Le connecteur Sync de la face avant fournit une sortie de synchronisation. Toutes les fonctions de sortie
standard (sauf la tension continue et le bruit) sont associées à un signal de synchronisation Sync. Pour les
applications dans lesquelles vous ne souhaitez pas envoyer le signal Sync, vous pouvez désactiver le
connecteur Sync. Le signal Sync peut être dérivé de l'une des voies d'un instrument 2 voies.
Comportement général
l

l

Par défaut, le signal Sync est dérivé de la voie 1 et envoyé au connecteur Sync (activé).
Lorsque le signal Sync est désactivé, le niveau de sortie sur le connecteur Sync est en logique
« basse ».

l

La polarité du signal Sync est spécifiée par la commande OUTPut:SYNC:POLarity {INVerted|NORMal}.

l

L'inversion d'un signal (voir Polarité des signaux) n'entraîne pas l'inversion du signal Sync associé.

l

l

Pour les signaux sinusoïdaux, carrés, triangulaires, les impulsions et les rampes, le signal Sync est un
signal carré « haut » dans la première moitié du cycle et « bas » dans la deuxième moitié. Les tensions
du signal Sync sont compatibles TTL lorsque son impédance de charge est supérieure à 1 kΩ.
Pour les signaux arbitraires, le signal Sync monte au début du signal et chute au milieu. Vous pouvez
ignorer ce comportement par défaut en utilisant la commande MARKer:POINt pour spécifier le point
dans le signal arbitraire où le signal Sync passe à l'état « bas ».

Modulation

l

l

l

Pour des signaux AM, FM, PM et PWM modulés en interne, le signal Sync est normalement référencé
sur le signal modulant (et non le signal porteur) et est un signal carré présentant un rapport cyclique
de 50 %. Le signal Sync est au niveau TTL « haut » pendant la première moitié du signal modulant.
Vous pouvez configurer le signal Sync pour suivre le signal porteur avec la commande
OUTPut:SYNC:MODE {CARRier|NORMal|MARKer} lorsque la modulation est interne.
Pour des signaux AM, FM, PM et PWM modulés en externe, le signal Sync est normalement référencé
sur le signal porteur (et non le signal modulant) et est un signal carré présentant un rapport cyclique
de 50 %.
Vous pouvez ignorer le comportement normal du signal synchrone (Sync) pour le forcer à suivre le
signal porteur OUTPut[1|2]:SYNC:MODE CARRier).
Pour la modulation par déplacement de fréquence (FSK), le signal Sync est référencé sur la fréquence
FSK. Le signal Sync est au niveau TTL « haut » lors de la transition vers la fréquence de saut.

Balayage
l

l

Le signal Sync est un signal TTL « haut » au début du balayage et « bas » au point médian du balayage.
Le signal Sync est synchronisé avec le balayage, mais n'est pas égal au temps de balayage du fait
que sa temporisation inclut le temps de réarmement.
Pour les balayages de fréquence avec marqueur actif, le signal Sync est un signal TTL « haut » au
début du balayage et « bas » à la fréquence du marqueur. Vous pouvez modifier ce paramètre à l'aide
de la commande OUTPut[1|2]:SYNC:MODE MARKER.

Source modulante
L'instrument accepte une source de modulation interne ou externe. Sur un instrument 2 voies, vous pouvez moduler les voies entre elles.
Sur la série 33600, vous configurez la source modulante pour accepter un signal de ±5 V
ou de ±1 V. Pour plus d'informations, voir INPut:ATTenuation[:STATe].

Source modulante : Interne (par défaut), autre source ou externe. La fréquence de la source de modulation externe peut atteindre 100 kHz.
Avec la source externe, un signal externe module le signal porteur. La profondeur de modulation (AM)
ou la variation de fréquence (FM) est contrôlé par le niveau de signal sur le connecteur Modulation In
de la face arrière. La bande passante à l'entrée de modulation externe est de -3 dB à 100 kHz.
Exemple AM : avec une profondeur de modulation de 100 %, lorsque le signal modulant est à +5 V,
l'amplitude de la sortie est maximale. Lorsque le signal modulant est à -5 V, l'amplitude de la sortie
est minimale.
Exemple FM : avec une variation de 10 kHz, un signal de +5 V correspond à une augmentation de fréquence de 10 kHz. Des signaux externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux
négatifs réduisent la fréquence au-dessous de la fréquence porteuse.

Modulation de phase (PM)
Un signal modulé se compose d'un signal porteur et d'un signal modulant. La modulation de phase (PM)
est très similaire à la modulation de fréquence (FM). Cependant, dans la modulation de phase, la tension
instantanée du signal modulant fait varier la phase du signal modulé.

Modulation de largeur d'impulsion (PWM)
Cette section décrit la modulation de largeur d'impulsion (PWM). La modulation PWM est disponible uniquement pour un train d'impulsions ; la largeur d'impulsion varie en fonction du signal modulant.
L'importance de variation d'une largeur d'impulsion est appelée variation de largeur ; elle peut être spécifiée en pourcentage de la période du signal (rapport cyclique) ou en unité de temps. Par exemple, si
vous spécifiez une impulsion avec un rapport cyclique de 20 % et activez ensuite la modulation PWM
avec une variation de 5 %, le rapport cyclique varie entre 15 % et 25 % sous le contrôle du signal modulant.

Signal de sortie du déclenchement (Trigger Out)
Un signal de sortie de déclenchement (trigger out) est fourni sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière
(utilisé uniquement en mode rafale et balayage). Lorsqu'il est activé, une impulsion avec un front montant
(par défaut) ou un front descendant est envoyée depuis ce connecteur au début du balayage ou de la
rafale.
l

l

l

l

l

Lorsque la source de déclenchement immédiate (interne) est sélectionnée, l'instrument envoie un
signal carré doté d'un rapport cyclique de 50 % à partir du connecteur Ext Trig au début du balayage
ou de la rafale. La fréquence du signal correspond à la période de la rafale ou au temps total de
balayage spécifiés.
Lorsque la source de déclenchement externe est sélectionnée, l'instrument désactive le signal « trigger out ». Le connecteur Ext Trig ne peut pas être utilisé simultanément pour les balayages ou les
rafales et la sortie de déclenchement (un signal déclenché en externe utilise le même connecteur
pour déclencher la rafale ou le balayage).
Lorsque la source de déclenchement Manuel ou Bus (logiciel) est sélectionnée, l'instrument envoie
une impulsion (largeur de >1 µs sur la série 33500 et de 100 ns sur la série 33600) à partir du connecteur Ext Trig au début de chaque balayage ou rafale.
Pour indiquer si l'instrument se déclenche sur le front montant ou descendant du connecteur Ext
Trig, appuyez sur [Trigger] > Trig Out Setup. Appuyez ensuite sur Trig Out pour sélectionner le front
désiré.

Mode rafale
Il existe deux modes rafale, décrits ci-dessous. Le mode sélectionné contrôle la source de déclenchement
et les autres paramètres qui s'appliquent.
l

l

Mode rafale commandée (par défaut) : L'instrument envoie un signal pendant un nombre spécifié de
cycles (nombre de salves) chaque fois que le signal déclencheur est reçu. Après avoir envoyé ce
nombre de cycles, l'instrument s'arrête et attend le déclenchement suivant. L'instrument peut utiliser
un signal déclencheur interne pour démarrer la rafale. Vous pouvez également effectuer un déclenchement externe en appuyant sur la touche [Trigger] de la face avant, en appliquant le signal déclencheur sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière ou en envoyant une commande de déclenchement
via le logiciel de l'interface distante.
Mode rafale commandée externe : Le signal de sortie est actif ou inactif en fonction du niveau du
signal externe appliqué sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Lorsque le signal de commande
est vrai, l'instrument envoie un signal continu. Si le signal de commande est faux, le cycle en cours se
termine, puis l'instrument s'arrête et sa tension reste au niveau correspondant à la phase de rafale initiale du signal sélectionné. La sortie du signal de bruit s'arrête immédiatement lorsque le signal de
commande devient faux.

Nombre de rafales
Nombre de cycles (1 à 100 000 000 ou infini) à envoyer par rafale. Utilisé uniquement en mode rafale
déclenchée (source interne ou externe).
l

Avec la source interne de déclenchement immédiate, le nombre de cycles spécifié est envoyé en permanence à une vitesse déterminée par la période de la rafale. La période de la rafale est le temps
entre les démarrages de rafales consécutives. Aussi, le nombre de rafales doit être inférieur au produit de la période de la rafale et de la fréquence du signal :
Période de la rafale > (Nombre de rafales)/(Fréquence du signal) + 1 µsec (série 33500)
Période de la rafale > (Nombre de rafales)/(Fréquence du signal) + 500 ns (série 33600)

L'instrument augmente la période de la rafale jusqu'à sa valeur maximale pour prendre en charge le
nombre de rafales spécifié (mais la fréquence du signal ne change pas).
En mode rafale commandée, le nombre de rafales est ignoré. Cependant, si vous modifiez le nombre

Période de la rafale
La période de la rafale est le temps écoulé entre le début d'une rafale et le début de la rafale suivante (1
µs à 8 000 s, 10 ms par défaut pour la série 33500). Sur la série 33600, la plage est comprise entre 1 µs et
4 000 s, et la valeur par défaut est également de 10 ms. La période de la rafale est différente de la
« fréquence du signal » qui spécifie la fréquence du signal.

Opérations système
Cette section décrit l'enregistrement des états de l'instrument, le rappel après extinction, les conditions
d'erreur, les autotests et le contrôle de l'affichage. Bien qu'elles n'aient pas de lien avec la génération de
signaux, ces opérations sont essentielles au bon fonctionnement de l'instrument.
Enregistrement des états de l'instrument
l

Il existe deux manières d'enregistrer et d'extraire des états de l'instrument :
l

l

à l'aide des noms de fichiers d'état sur la face avant, via les commandes MMEMory:STORe:STATe
et MMEMory:LOAD:STATe
au moyen des emplacements en mémoire 1 et 4, via les commandes *SAV et *RCL
Pour les instruments série 33600, les fichiers de configuration associés à *SAV et *RCL
sont enregistrés dans des fichiers appelés STATE_0.STA à STATE_4.STA. Ces derniers
sont situés dans le répertoire Paramètres de la mémoire interne. Vous pouvez gérer ces
fichiers à l'aide des commandes MMEMory.

l

l

l

163

Vous pouvez également utiliser l'emplacement d'enregistrement spécial 0 avec les commandes *SAV
et *RCL. Toutefois, cet emplacement est remplacé par l'état actuel de l'instrument à l'extinction.
Les deux méthodes d'enregistrement conservent la fonction sélectionnée (y compris les signaux arbitraires), la fréquence l'amplitude, la tension résiduelle CC, le rapport cyclique, la symétrie et les paramètres de modulation.
Si vous supprimez un signal arbitraire en mémoire non volatile après avoir enregistré l'état de
l'instrument, les données du signal sont perdues et l'instrument utilise la « croissance exponentielle »
à la place.

Référence de base de temps externe
Le connecteur BNC d'entrée de référence 10 MHz situé sur la face arrière de l'instrument
est isolé jusqu'à ±42 V crête du châssis. Le boîtier de ce connecteur BNC est isolé du reste
de l'instrument. La circuiterie interne tentera de maintenir la tension isolée dans les
limites de ±42 V crête par rapport au châssis. Toute tentative de configuration de cette
entrée au-delà de ±42 V crête du châssis peut détruire l'instrument et provoquer des
risques de blessures graves, voire mortelles.

La référence de base de temps externe permet aux connecteurs de la face arrière (10 MHz In et 10 MHz
Out) et aux circuits de synchroniser plusieurs instruments ou de synchroniser l'instrument avec un signal
d'horloge externe 10 MHz. Vous pouvez également configurer le déphasage du signal de sortie sur la face
avant ou l'interface distante.
Pour mettre deux instruments en phase, utilisez un oscilloscope 2 voies pour comparer les signaux de
sortie :
1. Connectez les 2 instruments avec la sortie 10 MHz raccordée à l'entrée 10 MHz. Utilisez l'instrument
avec la base de temps plus précise comme source de sortie de référence 10 MHz.

2. Connectez les sorties de l'instrument aux entrées de l'oscilloscope :

3. Réglez les deux instruments sur la même fréquence. L'oscilloscope doit afficher les signaux synchronisés en fréquence, mais déphasés (un signal carré suffit pour illustrer le déphasage).

Signaux arbitraires
Les signaux arbitraires peuvent répondre à certains besoins non satisfaits par les signaux standard de
l'instrument. Par exemple, vous aurez peut-être besoin d'une seule impulsion ou souhaiterez simuler des
imperfections dans un signal (par ex., suroscillation, oscillations, parasites ou bruit). Les signaux arbitraires, qui peuvent être très complexes, sont adaptés à la simulation des signaux rencontrés dans les systèmes modernes de communication.
Vous pouvez créer des signaux arbitraires à partir de 8 points au minimum (série 33500) ou de 32 points
(série 33600) jusqu'à 1 000 000 points. L'instrument mémorise les valeurs numériques correspondant à
ces points (échantillons) et les convertit en tensions lorsque le signal est généré. La fréquence de lecture
des points est la « fréquence d'échantillonnage » ; la fréquence du signal est égale à la fréquence
d'échantillonnage divisée par le nombre de points dans le signal. Par exemple, supposons qu'un signal
comporte 40 et que la fréquence d'échantillonnage soit de 10 MHz. La fréquence est alors (10 MHz)/40 =
250 kHz, d'où une période de 4 µs.
Signaux arbitraires doubles
Les signaux arbitraires peuvent être présents sur une voie, ou (avec l'option IQP) sur deux voies (par ex.,
signaux en bande de base IQ). Un double signal arbitraire est analogue à un fichier audio stéréo. Il comporte deux canaux d'informations qui contiennent le même nombre d'échantillons, commencent et se terminent toujours ensemble et sont toujours lus à la même fréquence d'échantillonnage.
Vous pouvez contrôler le déphasage et l'équilibre entre les voies de signaux arbitraires doubles via les
commandes du sous-système SCPI FUNCtion ou la face avant.

Filtres des signaux
L'instrument comporte deux filtres de signaux qui lissent les transitions entre les points lorsque des
signaux arbitraires sont générés.
l

l

l

Filtre normal : fournit une réponse en fréquence plate étendue. Cependant, sa réponse aux transitoires présente une oscillation transitoire et une suroscillation.
Filtre à paliers : fournit une réponse quasi-idéale aux transitoires, mais présente une oscillation plus
importante dans la réponse en fréquence que le filtre normal.
Désactivé : la sortie change brusquement entre les points avec un temps de transition d'environ 10
ns.

La fréquence de coupure de chaque filtre est une fraction constante de la fréquence d'échantillonnage du
signal. La réponse du filtre normal est de -3 dB à 27 % de la fréquence d'échantillonnage, tandis que la
réponse du filtre à paliers est de -3 dB à 13 % de la fréquence d'échantillonnage. Par exemple, pour un
signal arbitraire à 100 M.éch/s, la fréquence de la bande passante de -3 dB du filtre Normal est de 27
MHz.
La désactivation du filtre peut modifier la fréquence d'échantillonnage à une valeur inférieure si la fréquence était supérieure à 250 M.éch/s avant la désactivation.

Applications de séquencement des signaux
Les séquences de signaux arbitraires sont utiles lorsque le signal à générer répond à deux cas de figure :
l

l

Le signal est très long et contient des répétitions de fragments plus courts. Ces fragments peuvent
être répétés un nombre illimité de fois dans n'importe quel ordre.
Vous nécessitez d'un contrôle en temps réel (déclencheurs) pour passer d'un fragment de signal à un
autre.

Pour un exemple du premier cas, supposons un signal qui doit lire le même signal initial plusieurs fois,
puis lire trois autres signaux une fois chacun avant de relire le premier signal en continu. Il peut s'agir
d'un paquet de données de modem simulé comprenant un signal « inactif », un en-tête, quelques données, une somme de contrôle et un retour au signal « inactif ».
Ce cas peut comprendre la description de séquence suivante :
1. Lire « idle.arb » à 10 reprises
2. Lire « header.arb » une fois
3. Lire « data.arb » une fois
4. Lire « checksum.arb » une fois
5. Lire « idle.arb », répété indéfiniment.
Dans le deuxième cas, vous souhaiterez démarrer l'envoi de « header.arb » à l'aide d'un déclencheur matériel externe. Ce cas peut utiliser la description suivante :
1. Lire « idle.arb » de façon répétée jusqu'à la réception d'un signal déclencheur
2. Lire « header.arb » une fois
3. Lire « data.arb » une fois
4. Lire « checksum.arb » une fois
5. Lire « idle.arb », répété indéfiniment.
Un fichier de séquence (*.seq) contient les informations dans des listes numérotées, alors que les fichiers
de signaux arbitraires (*.arb) contient les signaux individuels mêmes.

Mise en œuvre du séquencement de signaux
L'instrument peut regrouper des séquences longues et complexes de signaux arbitraires (segments). La
commutation entre les segments a lieu en douceur et en temps réel. Par analogie, pensez aux segments
comme des morceaux dans un appareil de lecture de musique et aux séquences comme des listes de lecture.
Chaque partie d'une séquence spécifie un segment et le nombre de fois qu'il est lu. Elle indique également si la séquence attend un signal déclencheur avant la partie suivante et comment le signal Sync
est généré étape par étape.
Pour chaque segment, vous pouvez :
l

lire le segment entre 1 et 1 000 000 fois et passer ensuite à l'étape suivante

l

lire le segment une fois, puis arrêter et attendre un signal déclencheur avant de continuer

l

répéter le segment jusqu'à ce qu'un déclenchement se produise, puis continuer

l

répéter le segment jusqu'à son arrêt explicite

Options de génération du signal Sync :
l

Évaluer le signal Sync au début du segment

l

Ignorer le signal Sync au début du segment

l

Conserver la configuration actuelle du signal Sync dans tout le segment

l

Évaluer le signal Sync au début du segment et l'ignorer à un point défini dans le segment

Pour démarrer une séquence à la réception d'un signal déclencheur, placez un signal CC bref de 0 V (ou
toute autre valeur désirée) à l'avant des autres signaux de la séquence, et configurez le segment afin qu'il
attende un signal déclencheur avant de continuer. Pour les instruments de la série 33500, la longueur de
segment minimale est de 8 éch. Pour les instruments de la série 33600, la longueur de segment minimale
est de 32 éch.
Si un segment est configuré pour se répéter jusqu'à la réception d'un signal déclencheur,
il se termine toujours avant de passer au segment suivant. De plus, un segment court
peut se répéter pour d'autres cycles afin d'effacer le tampon d'échantillons de séquences
avant de continuer.

Bruit quasi-gaussien
Le signal de bruit est optimisé pour les propriétés statistiques quantitatives et qualitatives. Il ne se répète
pas sur une période supérieure à 50 ans de fonctionnement continu. À la différence d'une vraie distribution gaussienne, la probabilité d'obtenir une tension inférieure au réglage Vpp de l'instrument est
nulle. Le facteur de crête (tension en crête divisée par la tension efficace) est approximativement de 4,6.
Vous pouvez faire varier la bande passante du bruit de 1 mHz à la bande passante maximale de
l'instrument. L'énergie contenue dans le signal de bruit est concentrée entre le courant continu et la
bande passante sélectionnée, de façon que la densité spectrale du signal soit plus importante dans la
bande d'intérêt lorsque la bande passante est configurée avec une valeur faible. Dans les travaux audio,
par exemple, vous souhaiterez peut-être configurer la bande passante à 30 kHz de façon que la force du
signal dans la bande audio soit 30 dB supérieure à la bande passante configurée à 30 MHz.

PRBS
Une séquence binaire pseudo aléatoire (PRBS) comporte deux niveaux (haut et bas) et bascule entre eux
d'une manière difficilement prévisible sans connaître l'algorithme de génération de la séquence. Un
registre à décalage à rétroaction linéaire (LFSR) génère une séquence PRBS, illustrée ci-dessous.

Un registre à décalage à rétroaction linéaire (LFSR) est spécifié par le nombre d'étages qu'il contient et
les étages (piquages) en entrée des portes XOR (OU exclusif) dans son réseau de rétroaction. La sortie
PRBS provient du dernier étage. Avec des piquages correctement choisis, un registre LFSR à étage en L
produit un signal PRBS répétitif de longueur 2L-1. La fréquence d'horloge du registre LFSR détermine le
« débit binaire » du signal PRBS.
Les modèles de la série 33500 vous permettent de configurer L sur les valeurs 7, 9, 11, 15, 20 ou 23, ce
qui engendre des séquences d'une longueur comprise entre 127 et 8 388 607 bits.
Les modèles de la série 33600 vous permettent de configurer L sur toute valeur numérique comprise
entre 3 et 32, générant ainsi des séquences d'une longueur comprise entre 7 et 4 294 967 295 bits.
La valeur par défaut de L est 7, produisant une séquence d'une longueur de 127 bits.

Modulation
Modulation d'amplitude (AM)
L'instrument met en place deux formes de modulation d'amplitude :
l

La modulation à double bande latérale à signal porteur complète (DSB-FC), désignée dans la norme
ITU par le sigle A3E et utilisée dans la radiodiffusion AM.
L'équation de la modulation DSB-FC se présente comme suit :
y(t)= [(½)+(½)•d•m(t)]•Ac•sin(ωc t)
où
m(t) correspond au signal modulant
Ac correspond à l'amplitude du signal porteur
ωc correspond à la fréquence du signal porteur
d correspond à la « profondeur de modulation » ou une fraction de l'amplitude est utilisée par la
modulation
Par exemple, une profondeur de 80 % fait varier l'amplitude de 10 % à 90 % de l'amplitude configurée
(90 % - 10 % = 80 %) avec un signal modulant interne ou externe en pleine échelle (±5 V sur la série
33500, ±5 V ou ±1 V sur la série 33600). Vous pouvez configurer une profondeur de 120 % dès lors
que vous ne dépassez pas la tension de sortie maximale de l'instrument (±5 V dans une charge de
50 Ω, ±10 V dans une charge de haute impédance).
La trace supérieure représente le signal modulant, alors que la trace inférieure représente le signal
porteur modulé.

La modulation à double bande latérale à suppression de signal porteur (DSSC) De nombreux systèmes de communication modernes utilisent la modulation DSSC sur chacun des deux signaux porteurs de même fréquence mais déphasés de 90 degrés. Cette méthode est appelée modulation
d'amplitude en quadrature (QAM).
L'équation de la modulation DSSC est y(t)=d•m(t)•sin(ωc t)
En modulation DSB-SC, le signal porteur est inversé chaque fois que m(t) < 0. Pour la modulation
QAM, le deuxième signal porteur serait cos(ωc t), d'où un déphasage de 90 degrés par rapport au premier signal porteur.

205

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Consignes d'utilisation
Modulation de fréquence (FM)
La modulation de fréquence fait varier la fréquence d'un signal porteur en fonction du signal modulant :
y(t)=Ac•sin[(ωc+d•m(t) )•t]
où m(t) correspond au signal modulant et d à la variation de fréquence. La modulation FM est à bande
étroite si la variation est inférieure à 1 % de la bande passante du signal modulant (large bande autrement). Vous pouvez obtenir une approximation de la bande passante du signal modulé avec les équations
suivantes.
BW ≈ 2•(Bande passante du signal modulant) pour une FM à bande étroite
BW ≈ 2•(Variation + Bande passante du signal modulant) pour une FM à bande étroite
La trace supérieure représente le signal modulant, alors que la trace inférieure représente le signal porteur modulé.

Modulation de phase (PM)
La modulation de phase (PM) est similaire à la modulation FM, mais la phase du signal porteur varie à la
place de la fréquence :
y(t)=sin[ωc t+d•m(t) ]
où m(t) correspond au signal modulant et d à la variation de phase.

Consignes d'utilisation
Modulation par déplacement de fréquence (FSK)
La modulation par déplacement de fréquence (FSK) est similaire à la modulation de fréquence (FM), à la
différence près que la fréquence du signal porteur alterne entre deux valeurs prédéfinies : la fréquence du
signal porteur et la fréquence de saut. Parfois, les fréquences de saut et du signal porteur sont respectivement appelées « Marque » et « Espace ». La vitesse de commutation entre ces valeurs est déterminée par une horloge interne ou le signal sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Les variations de
fréquence sont instantanées et à phase continue.
Le signal modulant interne est un signal carré présentant un rapport cyclique de 50 %.
La trace supérieure représente le signal modulant, alors que la trace inférieure représente le signal porteur modulé.

Modulation par déplacement de fréquence binaire (BPSK)
La modulation BPSK est similaire à la modulation FSK. Toutefois, dans ce type de modulation, c'est la
phase du signal porteur, plutôt que sa fréquence, qui alterne entre deux valeurs. La vitesse de commutation entre ces valeurs est déterminée par une horloge interne ou le signal sur le connecteur Ext Trig
de la face arrière. Les variations de phase sont instantanées.
Le signal modulant interne est un signal carré présentant un rapport cyclique de 50 %.
Modulation de largeur d'impulsion (PWM)
La modulation PWM est disponible uniquement pour un train d'impulsions ; la largeur d'impulsion varie
en fonction du signal modulant. L'importance de variation d'une largeur d'impulsion est appelée variation
de largeur ; elle peut être spécifiée en pourcentage de la période du signal (rapport cyclique) ou en unité
de temps. Par exemple, si vous spécifiez une impulsion avec un rapport cyclique de 20 % et activez
ensuite la modulation PWM avec une variation de 5 %, le rapport cyclique varie entre 15 % et 25 % sous
le contrôle du signal modulant.

207

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Consignes d'utilisation
Modulation additive (somme)
La fonction « Sum » ajoute le signal modulant au signal porteur. Par exemple, vous pouvez ajouter à un
signal des quantités contrôlées de bruit à bande passante variable ou créer des signaux à deux fréquences porteuses. Le générateur interne de modulation de l'instrument peut produire le même signal
continu que le générateur principal ; la fonction Sum permet de créer de nombreux signaux qui auraient
nécessité deux instruments auparavant.
La fonction Sum augmente l'amplitude du signal de sortie de l'amplitude du signal modulant. Cela peut
entraîner le basculement de l'instrument vers une plage de tension supérieure en sortie qui provoque une
perte momentanée de signal. Si cela pose un problème dans votre application, activez la fonction Range
Hold. Si une augmentation de tension peut endommager votre dispositif testé, appliquez des limites de
tension.

Rafale
Vous pouvez configurer l'instrument afin d'émettre un signal sur un nombre déterminé de cycles, appelé
rafale. Vous pouvez utiliser les rafales dans l'un des deux modes suivants : rafales à N-cycles (également
appelées « rafales déclenchées ») ou rafales commandées.
Une rafale à N cycles est constituée d'un nombre donné de cycles de signaux (de 1 à 1 000 000). Elle est
toujours provoquée par un événement de déclenchement. Vous pouvez également définir le nombre de
cycles de rafale sur « Infinite », ce qui génère un signal continu lorsque l'instrument est déclenché.
Dans l'image ci-dessous, la trace supérieure représente la sortie de synchronisation et la trace inférieure,
la sortie principale.

Signal en rafale de trois cycles
Pour les rafales, la source de déclenchement peut être un signal externe, une horloge interne, une touche
ou une commande émise sur l'interface distante. L'entrée des signaux externes de déclenchement est le
connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Ce connecteur est relié à la masse du châssis (et non une masse
flottante). Lorsqu'il n'est pas utilisé comme entrée, le connecteur Ext Trig peut être configuré comme sortie afin de permettre à l'instrument de déclencher d'autres instruments en même temps que son déclenchement interne.
Une rafale à N cycles commence et finit toujours au même point du signal, appelé phase initiale.
En mode de rafale commandée (GATed), le signal de sortie est actif ou inactif en fonction du signal sur le
connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Sélectionnez la polarité de ce signal à l'aide de la commande
BURSt:GATE:POLarity. Lorsque le signal de commande est vrai, l'instrument envoie un signal continu. Si
le signal de commande est faux, le cycle en cours se termine, puis l'instrument s'arrête et sa tension
demeure au niveau correspondant à la phase de rafale initiale du signal. Pour un signal de bruit, la sortie
s'arrête immédiatement lorsque le signal de commande devient faux.

Balayage en fréquence
Le balayage en fréquence est similaire à la modulation de fréquence (FM), mais n'utilise pas de signal
modulant. À la place, l'instrument règle la fréquence de sortie d'après une fonction linéaire ou logarithmique ou une liste de 128 fréquences (max.) spécifiées par l'utilisateur. Un balayage linéaire change la
fréquence de sortie d'une valeur constante en Hz, alors qu'un balayage logarithmique change la fréquence d'une valeur constante de décades par seconde. Les balayages logarithmiques permettent de couvrir les plages de fréquence étendues où la résolution aux basses fréquences serait potentiellement
perdue dans un balayage linéaire.
Les balayages en fréquence sont caractérisés par un temps de balayage (pendant lequel la fréquence
change régulièrement de la fréquence initiale à la fréquence final), un temps de maintien (pendant lequel
la fréquence reste à la fréquence finale) et un temps de retour (pendant lequel la fréquence revient de
façon régulière et linéaire à la fréquence initiale). Les paramètres de déclenchement déterminent à quel
moment le balayage suivant commence.

Attributs des signaux CA
Le signal CA le plus courant est sinusoïdal. En effet, tout signal périodique correspond à la somme de différentes ondes sinusoïdales. En général, l'amplitude d'une onde sinusoïdale est donnée par sa valeur
crête, crête à crête ou de moyenne quadratique (RMS ou efficace). Toutes ces mesures supposent que le
signal ait un décalage de tension nul.

La tension de crête d'un signal est la valeur absolue maximale de tous ses points. La tension crête à crête
est la différence entre le maximum et le minimum. La tension efficace est égale à l'écart-type de tous les
points du signal ; elle représente également la puissance moyenne dans un cycle du signal diminuée de la
puissance de n'importe quelle composante CC du signal. Le facteur de crête est égal à la valeur crête
d'un signal divisée par sa valeur efficace. Il varie selon le signal. Le tableau ci-dessous présente plusieurs
signaux courants avec les facteurs de crête et les valeurs efficaces respectifs.

Consignes d'utilisation
Si un voltmètre à lecture de valeur moyenne est utilisé pour mesurer la « composante continue » d'un
signal, la lecture peut ne pas être conforme au réglage de la tension résiduelle CC. Ce risque existe parce
que le signal peut avoir une valeur moyenne non nulle qui s'ajouterait à la tension continue de décalage.
Vous pouvez rencontrer des niveaux CA exprimés en « décibels par rapport à 1 milliwatt » (dBm). Étant
donné que le gain dBm représente un niveau de puissance, vous devez connaître la tension efficace
(RMS) du signal et la résistance de charge pour effectuer le calcul.
dBm = 10 x log10 (P / 0.001) où P = VRMS2 / RL

Imperfections des signaux
Pour les signaux sinusoïdaux, les imperfections courantes sont plus faciles à décrire et à observer dans le
domaine des fréquences à l'aide d'un analyseur de spectre. Toute composante d'un signal de sortie ayant
une fréquence différente de la fondamentale (ou « porteuse ») est considérée comme une distorsion. Ces
imperfections peuvent se classer en distorsion harmonique, parasites non harmoniques ou en bruit de
phase ; elles sont exprimées en décibels par rapport au niveau de la porteuse ou « dBc ».
Distorsion harmonique
Les composantes harmoniques se produisent à des fréquences multiples de la fréquence fondamentale et
sont généralement créées par des composantes non linéaires dans la propagation du signal. Aux faibles
amplitudes du signal, une autre source possible de distorsion harmonique est le signal Sync qui est un
signal carré avec de nombreuses composantes harmoniques fortes qui peuvent s'introduire dans le signal
principal. Bien que le signal Sync soit fortement isolé des sorties du signal principal de l'instrument, le
couplage peut se produire dans le câblage externe. Pour de meilleurs résultats, utilisez des câbles
coaxiaux avec double ou triple blindage. Si le signal Sync n'est pas indispensable, ne le connectez pas ou
ne l'activez pas.
Parasites non harmoniques
Une source de parasites non harmoniques est le convertisseur numérique/analogique (DAC) qui convertit
le signal numérique en tension. La non-linéarité de ce convertisseur produit des harmoniques qui peuvent
être supérieures à la fréquence de Nyquist et sont donc repliées à une fréquence inférieure. Par exemple,
la cinquième harmonique de 30 MHz (150 MHz) peut créer un parasite à 100 MHz.
Le couplage de sources de signaux sans rapport (horloge système, par exemple) avec le signal de sortie
est une autre source de parasites non harmoniques. Ces parasites ont en général une amplitude
constante et sont plus perturbants avec des amplitudes du signal inférieures à 100 mVpp. Pour une
pureté de signal optimale à faible amplitude, conservez un niveau relativement élevé de la sortie de
l'instrument et utilisez un atténuateur externe.
Bruit de phase
Le bruit de phase est provoqué par de légères variations instantanées de la fréquence de sortie (« gigue »).
Sur un analyseur de spectre, il apparaît comme une augmentation du bruit de fond apparent à proximité
de la fréquence du signal de sortie. Le bruit de phase représente les amplitudes du bruit dans les bandes
1 Hz séparées de 1 kHz, 10 kHz et 100 kHz d'un signal sinusoïdal de 30 MHz. N'oubliez pas que les analyseurs de spectre comportent également du bruit de phase ; les niveaux que vous lisez peuvent comporter du bruit de phase des analyseurs.

Bruit de quantification
La résolution finie dans le convertisseur numérique/analogique du signal provoque des erreurs de quantification. En supposant que les erreurs sont uniformément réparties sur une plage de ±0,5 fois le bit de
poids faible, le niveau de bruit de signaux standard est environ égal à -95 dBc. À ce niveau, les autres
sources de bruit dans l'instrument sont dominantes. Cependant, le bruit de quantification peut poser un
problème dans les signaux arbitraires qui n'utilisent pas la plage complète des codes du convertisseur
numérique/analogique (-32 767 à +32 767). Dans la mesure du possible, mettez à l'échelle les signaux
arbitraires pour utiliser la plage complète.

Boucles de masse
La partie générant le signal de l'instrument est isolée de la masse du châssis (terre). Cette isolation élimine les boucles de masse dans le système et permet de référencer le signal émis par rapport à d'autres
tensions que la masse. La figure ci-dessous illustre l'instrument connecté à une charge via un câble
coaxial. Toute différence de potentiel de masse (VGND) tend à faire circuler le courant IGND dans le blindage du câble, provoquant ainsi une chute de tension due à l'impédance du blindage (ZSHIELD). Cette tension (IGND x ZSHIELD) apparaît comme une erreur dans la tension de la charge. Toutefois, si l'instrument
est isolé, une impédance série élevée (généralement, >1 MΩ en parallèle avec 50 nF) apparaît dans la propagation en opposition au passage de IGND et minimise donc cet effet.

Aux fréquences supérieures à quelques kHz, le blindage d'un câble coaxial devient inductif, et non résistif,
de sorte que le câble se comporte comme un transformateur. Dans ce cas, la tension chute dans le blindage du fait que IGND tend à se décaler de tensions égales dans le conducteur central, ce qui diminue les
effets des boucles de masse aux hautes fréquences. Les câbles coaxiaux constitués de deux ou trois blindages tressés sont beaucoup plus adaptés que ceux à blindages simples ou en feuilles, car leur résistance
est inférieure et ils deviennent par conséquent des transformateurs à basse fréquence.
Pour réduire les erreurs dues aux boucles de masse, connectez l'instrument à la charge via un câble
coaxial de qualité supérieure et reliez-le à la masse au niveau de la charge à l'aide du blindage. Si possible, branchez l'instrument et la charge sur la même prise électrique pour minimiser les différences de
potentiel de masse.
Rappelez-vous que les boîtiers extérieurs des connecteurs Sync et Modulation In sont connectés à ceux
des connecteurs de la sortie principale. Les câbles raccordés aux connecteurs Sync et/ou Modulation In
sont donc des sources potentielles de boucles de masse. Notez également que toute tentative
d'application de tensions différentes à ces boîtiers peut entraîner le passage d'un courant fort dans
l'instrument et éventuellement endommager ce dernier.

Présentation du langage SCPI
SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) est un langage ASCII de commande conçu
pour les instruments de test et de mesure. Les commandes SCPI sont basées sur une structure hiérarchique appelée système arborescent. Dans ce système, les commandes associées sont regroupées
dans un nœud (ou racine) commun pour former un sous-système. Une partie du sous-système OUTPut
est représentée ci-dessous pour illustrer l'arborescence.
OUTPut:
SYNC {OFF|0|ON|1}
SYNC:
MODE {NORMal|CARRier}
POLarity {NORMal|INVerted}
OUTPut est le mot clé racine, SYNC est un mot clé secondaire ; MODE et POLarity sont des mots clés tertiaires. Le signe ( : ) ) sépare un mot clé d'un mot clé de niveau inférieur.

Conventions syntaxiques
Le format des commandes est indiqué ci-dessous :
[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:UNIT {VPP|VRMS|DBM}
[SOURce[1|2]:]FREQuency:CENTer {<fréquence>|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault}
Cette syntaxe illustre la plupart des commandes (et certains paramètres) comportant des lettres majuscules et minuscules. Les majuscules indiquent l'abréviation des commandes. Pour réduire la taille des
lignes de programme, vous pouvez utiliser la forme abrégée. Pour une meilleure lisibilité des programmes, vous pouvez utiliser la forme longue.
Par exemple, dans l'instruction ci-dessus, VOLT et VOLTAGE sont deux formes acceptables. Vous pouvez
utiliser des majuscules ou des minuscules. Par conséquent, les formes VOLTAGE, volt et Volt sont toutes
acceptables. Les autres formes (par ex., VOL et VOLTAG) ne sont pas acceptables et génèrent une erreur.

Les accolades ( { } ) entourent les paramètres d'une commande donnée. Elles ne sont pas envoyées
avec la chaîne de commande.
Une barre verticale ( | ) sépare plusieurs paramètres dans une chaîne de commande donnée. Par
exemple, {VPP|VRMS|DBM} dans la commande ci-dessus indique que vous pouvez spécifier « VPP », «
VRMS » ou « DBM ». La barre n'est pas envoyée avec la chaîne de commande.
Les signes « inférieur » et « supérieur » ( < > ) indiquent que vous devez spécifier une valeur pour le
paramètre entouré. Par exemple, l'instruction suivante présente le paramètre <fréquence> entre les
signes < et >. Ces marqueurs ne sont pas envoyés avec la chaîne de commande. Vous devez spécifier
une valeur pour le paramètre (par ex., « FREQ:CENT 1000 »), sauf si vous sélectionnez une autre
option indiquée dans la syntaxe (par ex., « FREQ:CENT MIN »).
Certains éléments de syntaxe (par ex., nœuds et paramètres) figurent entre crochets ( [ ]). Cela
indique que cet élément est facultatif. Les crochets ne sont pas envoyés avec la chaîne de commande. Si vous ne spécifiez pas de valeur pour un paramètre facultatif, l'instrument choisit la valeur
par défaut. Dans les exemples ci-dessus, « SOURce[1|2] » indique que vous pouvez faire référence à la
voie source 1 par « SOURce » ou « SOURce1 » ou « SOUR1 » ou « SOUR ». De plus, comme le nœud
SOURce est facultatif (entre crochets), vous pouvez également faire référence à la voie 1 en omettant
le nœud SOURce, car la Voie 1 est la voie par défaut du nœud de langage SOURce. En revanche, pour
faire référence à la Voie 2, vous devez utiliser « SOURce2 » ou « SOUR2 » dans les lignes de programme.

Séparateurs de commandes
Le signe ( : ) ) sépare un mot clé d'un mot clé de niveau inférieur. Vous devez insérer un espace pour séparer un paramètre d'un mot clé de commande. Si une commande nécessite plusieurs paramètres, vous
devez les séparer par une virgule, comme illustré ci-dessous :
APPL:SIN 455E3,1.15,0.0
Dans cet exemple, la commande APPLy spécifie un signal sinusoïdal de fréquence 455 KHz d'une amplitude 1,15 volts avec une tension résiduelle CC de 0,0 volt.
Le point-virgule ( ; ) sépare les commandes dans un sous-système et minimise la frappe. Par exemple, la
chaîne de commande :
TRIG:SOUR EXT; COUNT 10
est identique aux deux commandes suivantes :
TRIG:SOUR EXT
TRIG:COUNT 10

Utilisation des paramètres MIN, MAX et DEF
Pour de nombreuses commandes, vous pouvez remplacer un paramètre par « MIN » ou « MAX » et par «
DEF » dans certains cas. Par exemple, examinons la chaîne de commande :

217

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Référence de programmation SCPI
[SOURce[1|2]:]APPLy:DC [{<fréquence>|DEF} [,{<amplitude>|DEF} [,{<tension
résiduelle>|MIN|MAX|DEF}]]]
À la place d'une valeur donnée pour le paramètre <tension résiduelle>, vous pouvez utiliser MIN pour définir la tension résiduelle à sa valeur minimale et MAX pour la définir à sa valeur maximale. Vous pouvez
également spécifier DEF pour configurer la valeur par défaut de chaque paramètre : <fréquence>, <amplitude> et <tension résiduelle>.

Requêtes sur les paramètres
Vous pouvez rechercher la valeur actuelle de la plupart des paramètres en ajoutant le
point d'interrogation ( ? ) à la commande. Par exemple, la commande suivante configure le nombre de
déclenchements avec 10 lectures :
TRIG:COUN 10
Vous pouvez ensuite rechercher le nombre avec la commande :
TRIG:COUN?
Vous pouvez également rechercher le nombre minimal et maximal autorisé :
TRIG:COUN? MIN
TRIG:COUN? MAX

Caractères de fin de commande SCPI
Une chaîne de commande envoyée à l'instrument doit se terminer par un caractère de <nouvelle ligne>
(<NL>). Le message IEEE-488 EOI (End-Or-Identify) est interprété comme le caractère <NL> et peut être
utilisé pour terminer une commande à la place du caractère <NL>. Le <retour chariot> suivi d'un caractère <NL> est également accepté. Le caractère de fin de commande réinitialise toujours le chemin de la
commande SCPI au niveau racine.
Pour chaque message SCPI comportant une requête et envoyé à l'instrument,
l'instrument termine la réponse renvoyée par un caractère <NL> ou un caractère de
fin de ligne (EOI). Par exemple, si « DISP:TEXT? » est envoyé, la réponse se termine
par <NL> après la chaîne de données qui est renvoyée. Si un message SCPI comporte plusieurs requêtes séparées par des points virgules (par ex., «
DISP?;DISP:TEXT? »), la réponse renvoyée se termine à nouveau par le caractère
<NL> après la réponse à la dernière requête. Dans tous les cas, le programme doit
lire ce caractère <NL> dans la réponse avant d'envoyer une autre commande à
l'instrument, faute de quoi une erreur se produit.

Commandes courantes IEEE-488.2
La norme IEEE-488.2 définit un ensemble de commandes qui exécutent des fonctions telles que la réinitialisation, les autotests et l'état de l'instrument. Les commandes courantes commencent toujours par un
astérisque (*), comportent 3 caractères et peuvent inclure un ou plusieurs paramètres. Le mot clé d'une

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

218

Référence de programmation SCPI
commande est séparé du premier paramètre par un espace. Utilisez un point-virgule ( ; ) pour séparer plusieurs commandes, comme illustré ci-dessous :
*RST; *CLS; *ESE 32;*OPC?

Types de paramètres SCPI
Le langage SCPI définit plusieurs formats de données à utiliser dans les messages des programmes et des
réponses.
Paramètres numériques
Les commandes qui nécessitent des paramètres numériques acceptent toutes les notations décimales
courantes des nombres, y compris les signes facultatifs, les points décimaux et la notation scientifique.
Les valeurs spéciales des paramètres numériques, telles que MIN, MAX et DEF sont également acceptées.
Vous pouvez également envoyer des suffixes d'unités techniques (par ex., M, k, m ou u). Si une commence accepte uniquement certaines valeurs données, l'instrument arrondit automatiquement les paramètres numériques d'entrée avec les valeurs acceptées. La commande suivante nécessite un paramètre
numérique pour la fréquence :
[SOURce[1|2]:]FREQuency:CENTer {<fréquence>|MINimum|MAXimum}
Du fait que l'interpréteur SCPI distingue les majuscules et les minuscules, il existe
une confusion sur la lettre « M » (ou « m »). Par commodité, l'appareil interprète «
mV » (ou « MV ») comme des millivolts, mais « MHZ » (ou « mhz ») comme des mégahertz. De même, « MΩ » (ou « mΩ ») est interprété comme des mégohms. Vous pouvez utiliser le préfixe « MA » pour méga. Par exemple, « MAV » est interprété comme
des mégavolts.

Paramètres discrets
Les paramètres discrets sont utilisés pour programmer des paramètres ayant un nombre limité de valeurs
(par ex., IMMediate, EXTernal ou BUS). Ils peuvent avoir une forme abrégée et une forme longue, tout
comme les mots clés des commandes. Vous pouvez combiner des majuscules et des minuscules. Les
réponses aux requêtes retournent toujours la forme abrégée en majuscules. La commande suivante
nécessite un paramètre discret pour l'unité de tension :
[SOURce[1|2]:]VOLTage:UNIT {VPP|VRMS|DBM}
Paramètres booléens
Les paramètres booléens représentent une condition binaire exclusivement vraie ou fausse. Pour une
condition fausse, l'instrument accepte « OFF » ou « 0 ». Pour une condition vraie, l'instrument accepte «
ON » ou « 1 ». Lorsque vous effectuez une requête sur un paramètre booléen, l'instrument renvoie toujours
la valeur « 0 » ou « 1 ». La commande suivante nécessite un paramètre booléen :
DISPlay {OFF|0|ON|1}

219

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Référence de programmation SCPI
Paramètres de chaînes de caractères ASCII
Les paramètres de chaînes de caractères peuvent pratiquement contenir n'importe quelle combinaison
de paramètres ASCII. Une chaîne de caractères doit commencer et se terminer par des guillemets simples
ou doubles. Vous pouvez inclure le délimiteur de guillemets dans la chaîne de caractères en le tapant
deux fois sans caractères entre eux. La commande suivante utilise un paramètre de chaîne de caractères :
DISPlay:TEXT <quoted string>
Par exemple, la commande suivante affiche le message « WAITING... » sur la face avant de l'instrument
(les guillemets ne sont pas affichés).
DISP:TEXT "WAITING..."
Vous pouvez également afficher le même message avec des guillemets simples.
DISP:TEXT 'WAITING...'

Utilisation du message Device Clear
Device Clear est un message de bas niveau du bus IEEE-488 que vous pouvez utiliser pour ramener
l'instrument dans l'état réactif. Différents langages de programmation et des cartes d'interface IEEE-488
permettent d'accéder à cette fonction au moyen de commandes propres. Les registres d'état, la
file d'erreurs et tous les états de configuration ne sont pas modifiés à la réception d'un message Device
Clear.
Device Clear effectue les actions suivantes :
l

Si une mesure est en cours, elle est annulée.

l

L'instrument retourne à l'état d'attente de déclenchement.

l

Les mémoires tampon d'entrée et de sortie de l'instrument sont effacées.

l

L'instrument est prêt à recevoir une nouvelle chaîne de commande.
La commande ABORt est la méthode recommandée pour terminer une opération
de l'instrument.

l

Interrompt toute action déclenchée (liste, balayage, rafale, lecture de signal arbitraire déclenché).
La commande ABORt n'a pas d'effet lorsque l'instrument est en mode normal ou modulé, sauf pour
les séquences de signaux arbitraires, les listes, les rafales et les balayages. Si l'instrument exécute
une séquence, une liste, une rafale ou un balayage, la commande ABORt redémarre l'élément interrompu avec la commande INIT et les conditions de déclenchement actuelles.
Lorsque la commande ABORt est en mode liste, la fréquence revient à la fréquence du mode « normal
» jusqu'à ce que le premier déclenchement se produise. Après le premier déclenchement, la première
fréquence de la liste est utilisée.
Si la commande ABORt est exécutée pendant un balayage, le balayage revient à la fréquence de
balayage initiale.
La commande ABORt s'applique aux deux voies d'un instrument 2 voies.

Sous-système AM
Le sous-système AM permet d'ajouter la modulation d'amplitude (AM) à un signal porteur.
Exemple
Pour générer un signal à modulation d'amplitude (AM) :
1. Configurez le signal porteur : Utilisez les commandes FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage et VOLTage:OFFSet pour spécifier la fonction du signal, sa fréquence, son amplitude et sa tension résiduelle.
2. Sélectionnez le mode de modulation d'amplitude : AM:DSSC
3. Sélectionnez la source de modulation (interne, externe, CH1 ou CH2) : AM:SOURce. Pour une source
externe, vous pouvez ignorer les opérations 4 et 5 ci-dessous.
4. Sélectionnez le signal modulant : AM:INTernal:FUNCtion
5. Définissez la fréquence de modulation : AM:INTernal:FREQuency
6. Définissez la profondeur de modulation : AM[:DEPTh]
7. Activez la modulation d'amplitude (AM) : AM:STATe:ON

Même à une profondeur supérieure à 100 %, l'instrument ne dépasse pas ±5 V en crête sur la sortie
(dans une charge de 50 Ω). Pour obtenir une profondeur de modulation supérieure à 100 %,
l'amplitude du signal porteur peut être réduite.
Avec AM:SOURce EXTernal, un signal externe module le signal porteur. La profondeur de modulation
est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (ou le niveau de signal ±1 V en option sur la série 33600) sur
le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par exemple, si la profondeur de modulation (AM
[:DEPTh]) est de 100 %, lorsque le signal modulant est à +5 V (ou éventuellement de +1 V sur la série
33600), l'amplitude de la sortie est maximale. De même, un signal modulant de -5 V (ou éventuellement de -1 V sur la série 33600) génère une amplitude de sortie minimale.

l'amplitude du signal modulant.
La modulation AM DSSC est utile pour certains modes numériques de modulation.
En modulation AM « normale », la modulation nulle provoque la sortie d'un signal porteur de demiamplitude. Lorsque le signal d'entrée de la modulation augmente, le signal porteur est modulé en
amplitude entre 0 et 100 % de l'amplitude.
En mode DSSC, le paramètre AM[:DEPTh] s'applique et met à l'échelle le signal de modulation de 0 à

Lorsque vous sélectionnez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la fréquence devient la fréquence du signal arbitraire, qui est basée sur la fréquence d'échantillonnage et le nombre de points
présents dans le signal arbitraire.
Lorsque vous utilisez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la modification de ce paramètre
se répercute sur les métadonnées en mémoire cache représentant la fréquence d'échantillonnage du
signal arbitraire. Vous pouvez également modifier la fréquence modulante d'un signal arbitraire à
l'aide des commandes FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FREQuency, FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PERiod et FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe. Ces commandes et la commande de la fréquence de modulation sont directement couplées afin de maintenir exactement le même comportement du signal arbitraire que lors
de sa dernière lecture. Si vous désactivez ultérieurement la modulation et sélectionnez le même
signal arbitraire, sa fréquence d'échantillonnage (et la fréquence correspondante en fonction du
nombre de points) sera la même que lors de sa lecture comme source de modulation.
Si la fonction interne est TRIangle, UpRamp ou DnRamp, la fréquence maximale est limitée à 200 kHz
sur la série 33500 ou à 800 kHz sur la série 33600. Si la fonction interne est PRBS, la fréquence fait
référence au débit binaire et est limitée, comme indiqué ici.

Si vous sélectionnez EXTernal, le signal porteur est modulé par un signal externe. En particulier :
l

AM : La profondeur de modulation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (ou le niveau de
signal ±1 V en option sur la série 33600) sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par
exemple, si la profondeur de modulation (AM[:DEPTh]) est de 100 %, lorsque le signal modulant
est à +5 V (ou éventuellement de +1 V sur la série 33600), l'amplitude de la sortie est maximale.
De même, un signal modulant de -5 V (ou éventuellement de -1 V sur la série 33600) génère une
amplitude de sortie minimale.
FM : Si vous sélectionnez la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si la variation de fréquence est de 100 kHz, un signal +5 V (éventuellement
de +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de fréquence de 100 kHz. Des signaux
externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs réduisent la fréquence au-dessous de la fréquence porteuse.
PM : Avec la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez réglé la variation de fréquence sur 180 degrés, un niveau de
signal +5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une variation de +180 degrés.
Des signaux externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs produisent une variation négative.
Impulsion comme fonction sélectionnée : La largeur d'impulsion ou la variation du rapport
cyclique des impulsions est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la
série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez
défini la variation de la largeur d'impulsion à 50 µs à l'aide de la commande PWM:DEViation, un
niveau de signal +5 V (éventuellement +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de
50 µs de la largeur. Des tensions externes inférieures produisent une variation inférieure.

Avec la source EXTernal, la phase (BPSK) ou la fréquence (FSK) de sortie est déterminée par le niveau
du signal sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Lorsque le niveau logique est bas, la phase ou
la fréquence porteuse est envoyée. Lorsque le niveau logique est haut, le déphasage ou la fréquence
de saut est envoyée.
La fréquence externe maximale BPSK est de 1 MHz et la fréquence maximale FSK, de 1 MHz.
Remarque : le connecteur utilisé pour les signaux BPSK ou FSK déclenchés extérieurement (Trig In)
n'est pas le même que celui utilisé pour les signaux modulés extérieurement AM, FM, PM et PWM
(Modulation In). Lorsqu'il est utilisé pour BPSK ou FSK, la polarité des fronts sur le connecteur Trig In
n'est pas réglable ; ce connecteur n'est pas affecté par la commande TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe.
Avec la source INTernal, la vitesse de commutation de la phase (BPSK) ou de la fréquence (FSKey) de
sortie entre la phase ou la fréquence porteuse et la phase ou la fréquence alternative est déterminée
par la vitesse BPSK (BPSK:INTernal:RATE) ou FSK (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).
Une voie ne peut pas être sa propre source de modulation.

Sous-système APPLy
Le sous-système APPLy permet de configurer des signaux complets en une seule commande. La forme
générale de la commande APPLy est indiquée ci-dessous :
[SOURce[1|2]:]APPLy:<fonction> [<fréquence> [,<amplitude> [,<tension résiduelle>]]]
Par exemple,
APPLy:SIN 1e4,1,0.1
remplace les commandes suivantes :
FUNCtion SIN
FREQ 1e4
VOLT 1
VOLT:OFF 0,1
OUTP ON
Non seulement la commande APPLy est rapide, mais elle évite également les conflits de paramètres qui
peuvent se produire en envoyant des commandes individuelles. De plus, la commande APPLy effectue les
opérations suivantes :
l

l

l

l

Définit la source de déclenchement sur IMMediate (équivalent à TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce IMMediate).
Désactive le mode modulation, balayage ou rafale activé et place l'instrument en mode signal
continu.
Active la sortie de la voie (OUTPut ON) sans modifier le réglage de la terminaison de sortie (OUTPut
[1|2]:LOAD).
Remplace le réglage de détection automatique de la tension et active la sélection automatique de la
plage (VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO).

L'instrument peut générer 8 types de signaux : tension CC, bruit gaussien, PRBS, impulsion, rampe/triangle, signal sinusoïdal, signal carré et signal arbitraire (défini par l'utilisateur). Le sous-système
FUNCtion inclut des paramètres propres aux signaux.
Vous pouvez également demander la configuration actuelle de la sortie (APPLy?).
Remarques générales
Amplitude
l

La modification de l'amplitude peut interrompre brièvement la sortie à certaines tensions en raison de
la commutation de l'atténuateur de sortie. Néanmoins, l'amplitude est contrôlée de façon que la tension de sortie ne soit jamais supérieure au réglage actuel lorsque la commutation a lieu. Pour éviter
cette interruption, désactivez la détection automatique de la tension à l'aide de la commande VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO OFF. La commande APPLy active automatiquement la détection automatique.

Limites imposées par l'impédance de sortie : La plage de la tension résiduelle dépend de l'impédance
de sortie. Par exemple, si vous configurez une tension résiduelle de 100 mVcc et modifiez ensuite
l'impédance de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance », la tension résiduelle affichée sur la face avant
est multipliée par deux et passe à 200 mVcc (aucune erreur générée). Si vous passez de « haute impédance » à 50 Ω, la tension résiduelle affichée est divisée par deux. Pour plus d'informations, reportezvous à la commande OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD.
Limites imposées par la sélection de l'unité : l'unité de sortie sélectionnée détermine les limites
d'amplitude.
Vous ne pouvez pas spécifier l'amplitude de sortie en dBm si la terminaison de sortie est réglée sur
une impédance élevée. Les unités sont automatiquement converties en Volts crête/crête (Vpp).

l

La définition d'une fréquence d'échantillonnage en mode non ARB ne modifie pas la fréquence. Par
exemple, si la fonction active est un signal sinusoïdal (sine), la définition de la fréquence
d'échantillonnage n'a pas d'effet tant que la fonction n'est pas modifiée à ARB.
Des fréquences d'échantillonnage élevées peuvent affecter l'amplitude réelle en raison d'une oscillation du filtre.
Options

l

Voir FUNCtion: ARBitrary pour connaître les options de signaux arbitraires disponibles. Avec FUNCtion:ARBitrary, vous pouvez sélectionner un signal arbitraire intégré ou le signal actuellement téléchargé en mémoire volatile à l'aide des commandes MMEMory.
Tension résiduelle

l

Le rapport entre la tension résiduelle et l'amplitude de sortie est illustré ci-dessous. Vmax est la tension de crête maximale compte tenu de l'impédance de sortie déclarée (soit 50 V pour une charge de
50 Ω ou 10 V pour une charge haute impédance).
|Voffset| < Vmax - Vpp/2

l

La séquence PRBS est créée par un générateur MLS (Maximum Length Sequence) (registre à décalage à retour linéaire) qu'il est possible de configurer avec plusieurs configurations standard. La configuration par défaut est PN7 à 1 000 bits/seconde.
Un signal PRBS utilisant le polynôme PNx est créé par un registre à décalage de x bits. Le signal de
sortie commence par x périodes d'échantillonnage de haut débit. La période d'échantillonnage est
l'inverse de la fréquence d'échantillonnage (FUNCtion:PRBS:BRATe) et l'impulsion Sync de la voie
indique le début du signal. Par exemple, si le signal PRBS utilise PN23 avec une fréquence
d'échantillonnage de 500 Hz, la sortie commence avec une fréquence haut débit de 46 ms (23 x 2
ms).
À la différence de la fonction APPLy:NOISe, la fonction APPLy:PRBS fonctionne avec la sortie Sync
activée. La fonction Sync indique le début de la séquence pseudo-aléatoire.

d'un signal ±5 Vcc dans une charge de 50 Ω ou d'un signal ±10 Vcc dans un circuit
ouvert.
Envoyer un signal carré de 3 V à 5 kHz avec une tension résiduelle de -2,5 V :
APPL:SQU 5 KHZ, 3,0 V, -2,5 V

Fréquence
l

La commande APPLy doit être adaptée à la fonction. Par exemple, la commande APPL:SQU 40 MHz
génère l'erreur « Data out of range » et l'instrument définit la fréquence à la fréquence maximale pour
un signal carré.
Tension résiduelle

l

Le rapport entre la tension résiduelle et l'amplitude de sortie est illustré ci-dessous. Vmax est la tension de crête maximale compte tenu de l'impédance de sortie déclarée (soit 50 V pour une charge de
50 Ω ou 10 V pour une charge haute impédance).
|Voffset| < Vmax - Vpp/2
Si la tension résiduelle saisie est incorrecte, l'instrument la règle au niveau maximal autorisé avec
l'amplitude spécifiée. Sur l'interface distante, l'erreur « Data out of range » est également générée.

l

Limites imposées par l'impédance de sortie : La plage de la tension résiduelle dépend de l'impédance
de sortie. Par exemple, si vous configurez une tension résiduelle de 100 mVcc et modifiez ensuite
l'impédance de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance », la tension résiduelle affichée sur la face avant
est multipliée par deux et passe à 200 mVcc (aucune erreur générée). Si vous passez de « haute impédance » à 50 Ω, la tension résiduelle affichée est divisée par deux. Pour plus d'informations, reportezvous à la commande OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD.

Sous-système BPSK
Le sous-système BPSK permet de moduler un signal avec le format de modulation par déplacement de
fréquence binaire (BPSK). En mode BPSK, le signal porteur est déphasé entre deux phases au moyen
d'une clé on/off. La source peut être interne en utilisant un signal carré à une fréquence donnée, ou
externe en utilisant l'entrée de déclenchement externe.
Si la fonction porteuse est un signal arbitraire, le déphasage n'affecte que la position des transitions
d'échantillons. Cela diffère du décalage de la phase du signal arbitraire global.
Exemple
Pour générer un signal BPSK :
1. Configurez le signal porteur : Utilisez les commandes FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage et VOLTage:OFFSet pour spécifier la fonction du signal, sa fréquence, son amplitude et sa tension résiduelle.
2. Sélectionnez la source de modulation (interne, externe, CH1 ou CH2) : BPSK:SOURce. Pour une
source externe, ignorez les opérations 4 et 3 ci-dessous.
3. Sélectionnez la phase BPSK : BPSK[:PHASe]
4. Définissez la cadence BPSK : BPSK:INTernal:RATE
5. Activez la modulation BPSK : BPSK:STATe ON

Si vous sélectionnez EXTernal, le signal porteur est modulé par un signal externe. En particulier :
l

l

l

l

l

l

l

l

l

AM : La profondeur de modulation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (ou le niveau de
signal ±1 V en option sur la série 33600) sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par
exemple, si la profondeur de modulation (AM[:DEPTh]) est de 100 %, lorsque le signal modulant
est à +5 V (ou éventuellement de +1 V sur la série 33600), l'amplitude de la sortie est maximale.
De même, un signal modulant de -5 V (ou éventuellement de -1 V sur la série 33600) génère une
amplitude de sortie minimale.
FM : Si vous sélectionnez la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si la variation de fréquence est de 100 kHz, un signal +5 V (éventuellement
de +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de fréquence de 100 kHz. Des signaux
externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs réduisent la fréquence au-dessous de la fréquence porteuse.
PM : Avec la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez réglé la variation de fréquence sur 180 degrés, un niveau de
signal +5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une variation de +180 degrés.
Des signaux externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs produisent une variation négative.
Impulsion comme fonction sélectionnée : La largeur d'impulsion ou la variation du rapport
cyclique des impulsions est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la
série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez
défini la variation de la largeur d'impulsion à 50 µs à l'aide de la commande PWM:DEViation, un
niveau de signal +5 V (éventuellement +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de
50 µs de la largeur. Des tensions externes inférieures produisent une variation inférieure.

Avec la source EXTernal, la phase (BPSK) ou la fréquence (FSK) de sortie est déterminée par le niveau
du signal sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Lorsque le niveau logique est bas, la phase ou
la fréquence porteuse est envoyée. Lorsque le niveau logique est haut, le déphasage ou la fréquence
de saut est envoyée.
La fréquence externe maximale BPSK est de 1 MHz et la fréquence maximale FSK, de 1 MHz.
Remarque : le connecteur utilisé pour les signaux BPSK ou FSK déclenchés extérieurement (Trig In)
n'est pas le même que celui utilisé pour les signaux modulés extérieurement AM, FM, PM et PWM
(Modulation In). Lorsqu'il est utilisé pour BPSK ou FSK, la polarité des fronts sur le connecteur Trig In
n'est pas réglable ; ce connecteur n'est pas affecté par la commande TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe.
Avec la source INTernal, la vitesse de commutation de la phase (BPSK) ou de la fréquence (FSKey) de
sortie entre la phase ou la fréquence porteuse et la phase ou la fréquence alternative est déterminée
par la vitesse BPSK (BPSK:INTernal:RATE) ou FSK (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).
Une voie ne peut pas être sa propre source de modulation.

Sous-système BURSt
Cette section décrit le sous-système BURSt.
Exemple
Vous trouverez ci-dessous un récapitulatif des opérations nécessaires à la génération d'une rafale.
1. Configurez la rafale : Utilisez la commande APPLy ou les commandes équivalentes FUNCtion,
FREQuency, VOLTage et VOLTage:OFFSet pour sélectionner la fonction, la fréquence, l'amplitude et
la tension résiduelle du signal. Vous pouvez sélectionner un signal sinusoïdal, carré, triangulaire,
PRBS, une rampe, un train d'impulsions ou un signal arbitraire (le bruit est autorisé uniquement en
mode rafale commandée ; le courant continu n'est pas autorisé). Pour les rafales déclenchées en
interne, la fréquence minimale est de 2,001 mHz. Pour les signaux sinusoïdaux et carrés, les fréquences supérieures à 6 MHz sont autorisées uniquement avec un nombre de cycles de rafale « infini
».
2. Sélectionnez le mode de rafale « déclenchée » ou « commandée » : Sélectionnez le mode rafale
déclenchée (« N Cycle » sur la face avant) ou le mode rafale commandée à l'aide de la commande
BURSt:MODE. Si vous utilisez le mode commandé, spécifiez la logique positive ou négative à l'aide de
la commande BURSt:GATE:POLarity.
3. Configurez le nombre de rafales : Définissez le nombre de rafales (nombre de cycles par rafale) à une
valeur comprise entre 1 et 100 000 000 cycles (ou infini) avec la commande BURSt:NCYCles. Utilisé
uniquement en mode rafale déclenchée. En mode PRBS, BURSt:NCYCles définit le nombre de bits de
la séquence binaire pseudo aléatoire (PRBS). Chaque rafale commence au début de la séquence.
4. Définissez la période de rafale : Définissez la période de rafale (intervalle de génération des rafales
déclenchées en interne) à une valeur comprise entre 1 μs et 8 000 secondes à l'aide de la commande
BURSt:INTernal:PERiod. Utilisé uniquement en mode rafale déclenchée avec une source de déclenchement interne.
5. Définissez la phase initiale de la rafale : Définissez la phase initiale de la rafale à une valeur comprise
entre -360 et +360 degrés à l'aide de la commande BURSt:PHASe.
6. Sélectionnez la source de déclenchement : Sélectionnez la source de déclenchement avec la commande TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce. Utilisé uniquement en mode rafale déclenchée.
7. Activez le mode rafale : Après avoir configuré les autres paramètres de la rafale, activez le mode
rafale (BURSt:STATe ON).

Modes rafale
Il existe deux modes rafale, décrits ci-dessous. L'instrument active un seul mode rafale à la fois.
l

l

Mode rafale commandée (par défaut) : L'instrument envoie un signal pendant un nombre spécifié de
cycles (nombre de salves) chaque fois que le signal déclencheur est reçu. Après avoir envoyé ce
nombre de cycles, l'instrument s'arrête et attend le déclenchement suivant. Vous pouvez configurer
l'instrument afin qu'il utilise un signal déclencheur interne pour démarrer la rafale. Vous pouvez également effectuer un déclenchement externe en appuyant sur la touche [Trigger] de la face avant, en
appliquant le signal déclencheur sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière ou en envoyant une commande de déclenchement logicielle à partir de l'interface distante.
Mode rafale commandée externe : La sortie de l'instrument est active ou inactive en fonction du
niveau du signal externe appliqué sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Si ce signal est vrai,
l'instrument envoie un signal continu. S'il est faux, le cycle en cours se termine, puis l'instrument
s'arrête et sa tension demeure au niveau correspondant à la phase de rafale initiale du signal sélectionné.

Le tableau suivant présente les modes associés aux fonctions de rafale.

La différence entre la rafale commandée et la sortie commandée est que la rafale commandée commence
et s'arrête d'après les cycles du signal, alors que la sortie commandée active et désactive l'instrument
avec un déclencheur externe, indépendamment de la phase du signal.
Si le rapport cyclique est modifié sur un signal carré déclenché en rafale avec le mode de
déclenchement réglé sur Temporisé, la rafale en cours se termine et une nouvelle rafale
est exécutée avant que le rapport cyclique de la rafale change.

La période de la rafale est le temps entre les démarrages de rafales consécutives.
Utilisée uniquement lorsque le déclenchement immédiat (IMMediate) est activé (TRIGger
[1|2]:SOURce IMMediate). Ignorée lorsque le déclenchement manuel ou externe est activé (ou en
mode rafale commandée).
Sur la série 33500, la période de rafale doit être calculée à l'aide de la formule suivante :
Période rafale ≥ (Nbre cycles / Fréquence du signal) + 1 μs.
Sur la série 33600, la période de rafale doit être calculée à l'aide de la formule suivante :
Période rafale ≥ (Nbre cycles / Fréquence du signal) + 500 ns, avec une période de rafale minimale
de 1 μs.

l

Si la période de rafale est trop faible, l'instrument l'augmente afin de déclencher à nouveau la rafale
de façon continue. Sur l'interface distante, l'erreur « Settings conflict » est également générée.

TRIGgered : l'instrument envoie un signal pendant un nombre spécifié de cycles (nombre de salves)
chaque fois qu'un signal déclencheur est reçu de la source de déclenchement (TRIGger
[1|2]:SOURce).
En mode de rafale commandée (GATed), le signal de sortie est actif ou inactif en fonction du signal
sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Sélectionnez la polarité de ce signal à l'aide de la commande BURSt:GATE:POLarity. Lorsque le signal de commande est vrai, l'instrument envoie un signal
continu. Si le signal de commande est faux, le cycle en cours se termine, puis l'instrument s'arrête et
sa tension demeure au niveau correspondant à la phase de rafale initiale du signal. Pour un signal de
bruit, la sortie s'arrête immédiatement lorsque le signal de commande devient faux.
GATed : le nombre de rafales, la période de la rafale et la source de déclenchement sont ignorés (utilisés uniquement en mode rafale déclenchée). Si un signal de déclenchement manuel est reçu TRIGger[1|2] ), il est ignoré ; aucune erreur n'est générée.

Notez que la commande BURSt:PHASe est utilisée à la place de la phase en sortie ; lorsque la rafale
est activée, la phase en sortie est nulle (0).
Pour les signaux sinusoïdaux, carrés et les rampes, 0 degré est le point auquel le signal traverse la tension de 0 V (ou la tension résiduelle CC) dans le sens positif. Pour les signaux arbitraires, 0 degré est
le premier point du signal. La phase initiale n'a pas d'effet sur le bruit.
Pour les signaux arbitraires sur la série 33500, la commande BURSt:PHASe est uniquement disponible si le signal comporte moins de 1 000 000 points.
Phase initiale également utilisée en mode rafale commandée. Lorsque le signal de commande devient
faux, le cycle du signal actif se termine et la sortie demeure au niveau de tension de la phase de rafale
initiale.

[SOURce[1|2]:]COMBine:FEED?
Active/désactive l'association des sorties des deux voies d'un instrument 2 voies sur le connecteur d'une
voie. Le mot clé « SOURce » (SOURce1 par défaut) spécifie la voie de base et <source> indique la voie à
associer à la voie de base.

Renvoi type
CH1, CH2 ou NONE

Définir la source COMBine:FEED de la voie de base 1 comme voie 2 :
COMB:FEED CH2
l

l

l

l

La commande COMBine:FEED permet d'ajouter les deux voies pour créer le signal sur la sortie du
convertisseur N/A de la voie de base.
Une seule voie à la fois peut fonctionner en mode COMBine:FEED.
À la différence des commandes Modulation et SUM, la commande COMBine:FEED peut ajouter deux
signaux modulés.
La commande COMBine:FEED peut générer des signaux modulés en quadrature à partir des deux
voies ajoutées dans un connecteur unique.

l

Pour utiliser la commande COMBine:FEED, configurez d'abord tous les paramètres de chaque voie.

l

Les signaux à associer peuvent avoir un déphasage constant entre les voies.

l

l

l

l

l

Vous pouvez utiliser la commande COMBine:FEED pour ajouter du bruit d'une deuxième voie à un
signal modulé sur la voie de base.
Si la sortie associée générée par la commande COMBine:FEED dépasse les caractéristiques nominales de l'instrument ou des limites programmées, l'instrument définit l'option COMBine:FEED sur
NONE et envoie une erreur de conflit de paramètres.
Les signaux sont associés sous forme numérique. Lorsque deux signaux d'amplitude considérablement différents sont associés, la résolution du signal de plus faible amplitude peut être
réduite proportionnellement au rapport entre les deux amplitudes.
La modification de l'amplitude de la fonction ou de la somme de la voie principale ou associée
n'entraîne pas la modification de l'amplitude ou de la tension résiduelle d'une autre fonction ou voie.
Si la modification de l'amplitude de la somme ou de la fonction de la voie principale ou associée
entraîne le dépassement des caractéristiques nominales ou des limites programmées, l'amplitude est
écrêtée ; une erreur de conflit de paramètres est signalée.
La modification de la tension résiduelle de la voie principale ou associée n'a aucune incidence sur
l'amplitude ou la tension résiduelle d'une autre fonction ou voie. Si la modification de la tension résiduelle de la voie principale ou associée entraîne le dépassement des caractéristiques nominales ou
des limites programmées, l'amplitude est écrêtée ; l'instrument signale une erreur de conflit de paramètres.

Si l'activation des limites ou le réglage de limites programmées implique qu'une limite est inférieure
au signal minimal, les limites ne sont pas activées ou réglées ; l'instrument signale une erreur de

Chaque valeur d'un point est un entier sur 16 bits compris entre -32 767 et +32 767 ou une valeur
32 bits à virgule flottante comprise entre -1,0 et +1,0. Le nombre total d'octets nécessaire est donc
égal à deux ou quatre fois le nombre de valeurs des points du signal. Par exemple, 16 000 octets sont
nécessaires pour télécharger un signal de 8 000 sous forme d'entiers, mais 32 000 octets sont nécessaires pour télécharger le même signal sous forme de valeurs à virgule flottante.
Les valeurs -32 767 et +32 767 ou -1,0 à +1,.0 correspondent aux valeurs de crête du signal (si la tension résiduelle est égale à 0 V). Par exemple, si vous définissez l'amplitude de sortie à 10 Vpp,
+32 767 correspond à +5 V et -32 767 à -5 V.
Utilisez la commande FORMat:BORDer pour sélectionner l'ordre des octets pour les transferts de
blocs de données binaires.
Utilisez la commande DATA:ARB2:FORMat pour indiquer si des signaux arbitraires doubles sont entrelacés ou séquentiels (voie 1 suivie de la voie 2).
La spécification d'un signal déjà chargé génère l'erreur « Specified arb waveform already exists ».
Pour supprimer un signal existant, vous devez effacer toute la mémoire des signaux à l'aide de la commande DATA:VOLatile:CLEar.
La taille totale des échantillons disponible pour tous les signaux chargés par voie est de 1 M.éch ou
16 de M.éch (série 33500) ou de 4 M.éch ou 64 M.éch (série 33600), selon le modèle et les options.
Un nouveau signal peut être limité par des signaux déjà chargés.
Quelles que soient les options installées, la taille de signal maximale pour l'éditeur de
signaux intégré est de 1 Méch.

Limitations concernant les signaux arbitraires : Pour les signaux arbitraires, l'amplitude est limitée si
les points du signal ne couvrent pas toute la plage du convertisseur N/A de sortie. Par exemple, le
signal intégré « Sinc » n'utilise pas la plage totale de valeurs ; son amplitude est donc limitée à 6,087
Vpp (dans une charge de 50 Ω).

Même les signaux arbitraires comportant des millions de points peuvent être insuffisants pour les
applications nécessitant une séquence répétitive spéciale de signaux en fonction du temps et des événements externes. Les séquences de signaux arbitraires permettent de disposer et de reproduire des
signaux sous certaines conditions. Cela permet d'utiliser moins de mémoire et de réaliser des applications plus souples et flexibles.

l

once- lire une seule fois
onceWaitTrig- lire une fois, puis attendre un déclenchement. Les déclenchements ne sont pas
acceptés tant que la lecture du segment spécifié n'est pas terminée.

l

repeatTilTrig - recommencer jusqu'au déclenchement, puis passer à l'étape suivante
Pour les petits signaux, plusieurs cycles peuvent être nécessaires après la
réception du déclenchement pour passer au signal suivant. Cela est dû au fait
que les échantillons contenus dans la mémoire tampon doivent être effacés.

l

l

l

<mode marqueur> est une chaîne de caractères entre guillemets facultative qui indique le comportement du marqueur dans le signal arbitraire :
l

maintain- maintient l'état du marqueur actuel au début du segment

l

lowAtStart- force la position basse du marqueur au début du segment

l

highAtStart- force la position haute du marqueur au début du segment

l

<point marqueur> nombre indiquant l'emplacement du marqueur dans le signal arbitraire Cette
valeur doit être comprise entre 4 et le nombre de points contenus dans le signal arbitraire moins
3.

Si vous spécifiez un signal arbitraire qui n'est pas chargé, l'erreur « Specified arb waveform does not
exist » est générée.

Exemple de commande DATA:SEQuence

La commande suivante crée une séquence (baptisée mySequence) de 3 segments (A.arb, B.arb et C.arb)
précédemment chargés à partir d'une clé USB avec la commande MMEMory:LOAD:DATA[1|2]. Cette
séquence lit A une fois et B cinq fois. Elle lit ensuite C en boucle en attendant un déclenchement pour
continuer et se termine finalement par A. Le <point marqueur> est réglé sur 10.
La commande est représentée sur plusieurs lignes à des fins de lisibilité uniquement.
DATA:SEQ #3158"mySequence","USB:\A.arb",0,once,lowAtStart,10,"USB:\B.arb",5,repeat,highAtStart,10,
"USB:\C.arb",0,repeatTilTrig,maintain,10,"USB:\A.arb",0,once,lowAtStart,10
De nombreux éditeurs de texte permettent de compter le nombre d'octets dans un bloc en affichant simplement en surbrillance une chaîne de texte. Dans cet exemple, la taille est égale à 158, qui requiert 3
chiffres pour la représenter, d'où l'en-tête #3158.
Cette approche nécessite de précharger tous les signaux arbitraires et de définir l'amplitude et la tension
résiduelle (ou les niveaux inférieur et supérieur), la fréquence d'échantillonnage et le filtre. Reportezvous à la commande MMEM:LOAD:DATA pour regrouper toutes ces informations dans un seul fichier plutôt que de créer un transfert en bloc avec plusieurs commandes SCPI.

La variation ne peut être supérieure à la fréquence porteuse. Si vous tentez de définir une variation
supérieure à la fréquence porteuse (en mode FM activé), l'instrument ajuste la variation à la valeur
maximale autorisée pour cette fréquence. Sur l'interface distante, l'erreur « Settings conflict » est également générée.
La fréquence porteuse augmentée de la variation ne peut pas être supérieure à la fréquence maximale de la fonction sélectionnée plus 100 kHz. Si vous tentez de régler la variation sur une valeur
incorrecte, l'instrument l'ajuste à la valeur maximale autorisée avec la fréquence porteuse active.
L'interface distante génère également l'erreur « Data out of range ».
Si en raison de la variation, le signal porteur est à une fréquence supérieure à la limite pour le rapport
cyclique actif (signal carré uniquement), l'instrument ajuste le rapport cyclique à la valeur maximale
autorisée avec la fréquence porteuse actuelle. Sur l'interface distante, l'erreur « Settings conflict » est
également générée.
Si vous sélectionnez la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le signal ±5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par
exemple, si la variation de fréquence est de 100 kHz, un signal +5 V (éventuellement de +1 V sur la
série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de fréquence de 100 kHz. Des signaux externes plus
faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs réduisent la fréquence au-dessous de
la fréquence porteuse.

Lorsque vous sélectionnez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la fréquence devient la fréquence du signal arbitraire, qui est basée sur la fréquence d'échantillonnage et le nombre de points
présents dans le signal arbitraire.
Lorsque vous utilisez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la modification de ce paramètre
se répercute sur les métadonnées en mémoire cache représentant la fréquence d'échantillonnage du
signal arbitraire. Vous pouvez également modifier la fréquence modulante d'un signal arbitraire à
l'aide des commandes FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FREQuency, FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PERiod et FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe. Ces commandes et la commande de la fréquence de modulation sont directement couplées afin de maintenir exactement le même comportement du signal arbitraire que lors
de sa dernière lecture. Si vous désactivez ultérieurement la modulation et sélectionnez le même
signal arbitraire, sa fréquence d'échantillonnage (et la fréquence correspondante en fonction du
nombre de points) sera la même que lors de sa lecture comme source de modulation.
Si la fonction interne est TRIangle, UpRamp ou DnRamp, la fréquence maximale est limitée à 200 kHz
sur la série 33500 ou à 800 kHz sur la série 33600. Si la fonction interne est PRBS, la fréquence fait
référence au débit binaire et est limitée, comme indiqué ici.
Cette commande doit être utilisée uniquement avec la source de modulation interne (FM:SOURce
INTernal).

Si vous sélectionnez EXTernal, le signal porteur est modulé par un signal externe. En particulier :
l

l

l

l

l

l

l

l

l

AM : La profondeur de modulation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (ou le niveau de
signal ±1 V en option sur la série 33600) sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par
exemple, si la profondeur de modulation (AM[:DEPTh]) est de 100 %, lorsque le signal modulant
est à +5 V (ou éventuellement de +1 V sur la série 33600), l'amplitude de la sortie est maximale.
De même, un signal modulant de -5 V (ou éventuellement de -1 V sur la série 33600) génère une
amplitude de sortie minimale.
FM : Si vous sélectionnez la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si la variation de fréquence est de 100 kHz, un signal +5 V (éventuellement
de +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de fréquence de 100 kHz. Des signaux
externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs réduisent la fréquence au-dessous de la fréquence porteuse.
PM : Avec la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez réglé la variation de fréquence sur 180 degrés, un niveau de
signal +5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une variation de +180 degrés.
Des signaux externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs produisent une variation négative.
Impulsion comme fonction sélectionnée : La largeur d'impulsion ou la variation du rapport
cyclique des impulsions est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la
série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez
défini la variation de la largeur d'impulsion à 50 µs à l'aide de la commande PWM:DEViation, un
niveau de signal +5 V (éventuellement +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de
50 µs de la largeur. Des tensions externes inférieures produisent une variation inférieure.

Avec la source EXTernal, la phase (BPSK) ou la fréquence (FSK) de sortie est déterminée par le niveau
du signal sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Lorsque le niveau logique est bas, la phase ou
la fréquence porteuse est envoyée. Lorsque le niveau logique est haut, le déphasage ou la fréquence
de saut est envoyée.
La fréquence externe maximale BPSK est de 1 MHz et la fréquence maximale FSK, de 1 MHz.
Remarque : le connecteur utilisé pour les signaux BPSK ou FSK déclenchés extérieurement (Trig In)
n'est pas le même que celui utilisé pour les signaux modulés extérieurement AM, FM, PM et PWM
(Modulation In). Lorsqu'il est utilisé pour BPSK ou FSK, la polarité des fronts sur le connecteur Trig In
n'est pas réglable ; ce connecteur n'est pas affecté par la commande TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe.
Avec la source INTernal, la vitesse de commutation de la phase (BPSK) ou de la fréquence (FSKey) de
sortie entre la phase ou la fréquence porteuse et la phase ou la fréquence alternative est déterminée
par la vitesse BPSK (BPSK:INTernal:RATE) ou FSK (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).
Une voie ne peut pas être sa propre source de modulation.

Sous-système FREQuency
Le sous-système FREQuency contrôle la fréquence de sortie de l'instrument. Dans les
instruments 2 voies, les fréquences des voies peuvent être couplées de diverses manières.
La commande FREQuency:COUPle[:STATe] {ON|OFF|ONCE} active ou désactive le couplage. Ou bien, à
l'aide de l'option ONCE, elle copie une voie dans une autre sans la coupler à cette dernière.
FREQuency:COUPle:MODE {OFFSet|RATio} spécifie le mode de couplage des fréquences.
FREQuency:MODE permet de spécifier le mode de fréquence à utiliser, y compris le balayage, une liste
de fréquences ou une fréquence constante.

à l'autre voie. Par exemple, supposons que l'instrument soit activé FREQ:COUPLE:STATE ON et en mode
FREQ:COUPLE:MODE OFFSET (mode décalage des fréquences actif) et que la voie 1 fonctionne à 1,0
MHz. Avec la commande SOURce1:FREQuency:COUPle:OFFSet 500, la voie 1 demeure à 1,0 MHz et la

l

Si vous sélectionnez EXTernal, le signal porteur est modulé par un signal externe. En particulier :
l

l

l

l

l

l

l

l

l

AM : La profondeur de modulation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (ou le niveau de
signal ±1 V en option sur la série 33600) sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par
exemple, si la profondeur de modulation (AM[:DEPTh]) est de 100 %, lorsque le signal modulant
est à +5 V (ou éventuellement de +1 V sur la série 33600), l'amplitude de la sortie est maximale.
De même, un signal modulant de -5 V (ou éventuellement de -1 V sur la série 33600) génère une
amplitude de sortie minimale.
FM : Si vous sélectionnez la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si la variation de fréquence est de 100 kHz, un signal +5 V (éventuellement
de +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de fréquence de 100 kHz. Des signaux
externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs réduisent la fréquence au-dessous de la fréquence porteuse.
PM : Avec la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez réglé la variation de fréquence sur 180 degrés, un niveau de
signal +5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une variation de +180 degrés.
Des signaux externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs produisent une variation négative.
Impulsion comme fonction sélectionnée : La largeur d'impulsion ou la variation du rapport
cyclique des impulsions est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la
série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez
défini la variation de la largeur d'impulsion à 50 µs à l'aide de la commande PWM:DEViation, un
niveau de signal +5 V (éventuellement +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de
50 µs de la largeur. Des tensions externes inférieures produisent une variation inférieure.

Avec la source EXTernal, la phase (BPSK) ou la fréquence (FSK) de sortie est déterminée par le niveau
du signal sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Lorsque le niveau logique est bas, la phase ou
la fréquence porteuse est envoyée. Lorsque le niveau logique est haut, le déphasage ou la fréquence
de saut est envoyée.
La fréquence externe maximale BPSK est de 1 MHz et la fréquence maximale FSK, de 1 MHz.
Remarque : le connecteur utilisé pour les signaux BPSK ou FSK déclenchés extérieurement (Trig In)
n'est pas le même que celui utilisé pour les signaux modulés extérieurement AM, FM, PM et PWM
(Modulation In). Lorsqu'il est utilisé pour BPSK ou FSK, la polarité des fronts sur le connecteur Trig In
n'est pas réglable ; ce connecteur n'est pas affecté par la commande TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe.
Avec la source INTernal, la vitesse de commutation de la phase (BPSK) ou de la fréquence (FSKey) de
sortie entre la phase ou la fréquence porteuse et la phase ou la fréquence alternative est déterminée
par la vitesse BPSK (BPSK:INTernal:RATE) ou FSK (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).
Une voie ne peut pas être sa propre source de modulation.

Le signal sélectionné (autre qu'un signal arbitraire) est envoyé en utilisant la fréquence, l'amplitude et

réglages spécifiés dans le fichier du signal arbitraire. Les nouveaux signaux arbitraires héritent des
réglages actifs pour les signaux arbitraires.
NOISe produit un bruit blanc gaussien ayant une bande passante réglable et un facteur de crête
approximativement égal à 3,5.
PRBS génère un bruit pseudo-aléatoire à l'aide des méthodes de registre à décalage à retour linéaire
(LFSR - Linear Feedback Shift Register) choisies par l'utilisateur.
ARB génère le signal arbitraire sélectionné par FUNCtion:ARBitrary.
Limitations concernant les fonctions : Si vous passez à une fonction dont la fréquence maximale est
inférieure à celle de la fonction active, la fréquence est ajustée à la valeur maximale de la nouvelle
fonction. Par exemple, si vous modifiez un signal sinusoïdal haute fréquence pour la fonction rampe,
l'instrument ajuste la fréquence de sortie à 200 kHz (limite supérieure des rampes). Sur l'interface distante, l'erreur « Settings conflict » est également générée.
Limitations concernant l'amplitude : Si vous passez à une fonction dont l'amplitude maximale est inférieure à celle de la fonction active, l'amplitude est ajustée à la valeur maximale de la nouvelle fonction. C'est notamment le cas lorsque les unités de sortie sont Veff ou dBm en raison des différences
de facteur de crête pour les diverses de fonctions de sortie. Par exemple, si vous modifiez un signal
carré 5 Vrms (dans une charge de 50 Ω) en signal sinusoïdal, l'instrument ajuste l'amplitude à 3,536
Veff (limite maximale Vrms pour un signal sinusoïdal). L'interface distante génère également une
erreur de conflit des paramètres.

fréquence est également réduite à 7,8125 MHz pour un signal de 8 points (série 33500) ou au quart
de celle d'un signal de 32 points (série 33600).
La fréquence et la fréquence d'échantillonnage du signal arbitraire ne sont pas couplées avec
SOUR:FREQ, qui s'applique uniquement aux signaux non arbitraires.
Le signal arbitraire est lu à la vitesse spécifiée par la fréquence d'échantillonnage. Lorsque vous définissez la fréquence ou la période d'un signal arbitraire, l'instrument modifie la fréquence
d'échantillonnage en fonction du nombre de points dans le signal et de la nouvelle fréquence ou de la
nouvelle période. La nouvelle fréquence ou période peut être légèrement modifiée pour respecter les
limitations de résolution de la fréquence d'échantillonnage et du nombre de points. En d'autres
termes, la fréquence est recalculée à partir de la nouvelle fréquence d'échantillonnage et du nombre
de points pour assurer la compatibilité entre les paramètres couplés. Cela est dû à la résolution
mathématique de 15 chiffres associée à une fréquence d'échantillonnage qui peut également être
exprimée sur 15 chiffres.
Toute modification du nombre de points du signal ou de la fréquence d'échantillonnage à l'aide de la
commande FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe est répercutée sur les réglages de fréquence et de période.

Limites imposées par l'amplitude : Vous pouvez configurer des niveaux de tension positifs ou négatifs

Différences entre l'utilisation à distance et sur la face avant :
l

l

l

l

Interface distante : La configuration du niveau haut ou bas à partir de l'interface distante peut
modifier le niveau haut ou bas pour obtenir le réglage souhaité. Dans ce cas, l'erreur « Data out of
range » ou « Settings conflict » s'affiche. Si le niveau haut est défini sous le niveau bas, l'instrument
configure le niveau bas 1 mV sous le niveau haut. Si le niveau bas est configuré sous la limite inférieure (LOW) ou des spécifications de sortie de l'instrument, le niveau bas est réglé sur la limite
inférieure (LOW) ou les spécifications de sortie de l'instrument et le niveau haut est défini à 1 mV
au-dessus du niveau bas. Un ensemble de règles similaires s'applique si le niveau bas est configuré incorrectement.
De même, vous pouvez configurer le niveau bas au-dessus du niveau haut à partir de l'interface
distante. Dans ce cas, l'instrument définit le niveau haut à 1 mV au-dessus du niveau bas. Si le
niveau bas est supérieur à la limite maximale (HIGH) des spécifications de sortie de l'instrument,
le niveau haut est configuré avec la limite maximale (HIGH) ou les spécifications de sortie de
l'instrument et le niveau bas est défini à 1 mV au-dessous du niveau haut.
Face avant : La configuration du niveau haut ou bas sur la face avant peut rogner ce niveau pour
obtenir le niveau souhaité ; l'erreur « Data out of range » est générée. Il n'est pas possible de configurer un niveau haut inférieur au niveau bas sur la face avant.

La configuration des niveaux haut et bas entraîne également celle de l'amplitude et de la tension résiduelle du signal. Par exemple, si vous réglez le niveau haut sur +2 V et le niveau bas sur -3 V,
l'amplitude résultante est de 5 Vpp avec une tension résiduelle de -500 mV.

Limites imposées par l'impédance de sortie : Si vous modifiez le réglage de la terminaison de sortie, la
tension affichée est ajustée (aucune erreur n'est générée). Par exemple, si vous définissez le niveau
haut à +100 mVcc et que vous modifiez ensuite la terminaison de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance
», l'amplitude affichée sur la face avant double et devient +200 mVcc. Si vous changez de « haute
impédance » à 50 Ω, l'amplitude affichée est divisée par 2. La modification de l'impédance de sortie
n’a aucune répercussion sur la tension aux bornes de sortie de l'instrument. Seules les valeurs affichées sur la face avant et les valeurs demandées sur l'interface distante sont modifiées. La tension
sur la sortie de l'instrument dépend de la charge connectée à l'instrument. Pour plus d'informations,
reportez-vous à la commande OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD.
Limites imposées par les limites de tension : Si les limites de tension sont activées, les réglages de
tension sont vérifiés par rapport aux limites spécifiées (VOLTage:LIMit:HIGH, VOLTage:LIMit:LOW)
avant qu'un changement de niveau ne soit effectué. Si le niveau de sortie varie au-delà du réglage
LIMIT, il est fixé au maximum (ou minimum) autorisé qui n'est pas supérieur à cette valeur LIMit ;
l'erreur « Settings conflict » est générée.
Limites imposées par le couplage des sorties : Si 2 voies sont couplées, les limites sont vérifiées sur
ces 2 voies avant de modifier un niveau. Dans ce cas, si le niveau varie au-delà du réglage LIMIT ou
des spécifications de sortie de l'instrument pour une des voies, il est fixé au maximum (ou minimum)
autorisé ; l'erreur « Settings conflict » est générée.
Pour inverser un signal par rapport à la tension résiduelle, utilisez OUTPut[1|2]:POLarity.

La fréquence d'échantillonnage et la fréquence ne sont pas couplées lors de la lecture d'un segment
de signal arbitraire. Le concept de fréquence ne s'applique pas aux séquences de signaux arbitraires.
La définition d'une fréquence d'échantillonnage en mode non ARB ne modifie pas la fréquence. Par
exemple, si la fonction active est un signal sinusoïdal (sine), la définition de la fréquence
d'échantillonnage n'a pas d'effet tant que la fonction n'est pas modifiée à ARB.
La fréquence maximale d'échantillonnage dépend du filtre appliqué au signal arbitraire. Pour plus
d'informations, reportez-vous à la section FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FILTer.

Cette commande interrompt et redémarre les signaux arbitraires sur les deux voies aux fréquences
d'échantillonnage configurées.
Si les deux signaux arbitraires comportent le même nombre de points et la même fréquence
d'échantillonnage, ils demeurent synchronisés sur plusieurs répétitions. Sinon, ils sont synchronisés
initialement et après plusieurs répétitions qui représentent des multiples du nombre de points dans
chaque signal. Par exemple, si vous synchronisez un signal de 8 points et un signal de 10 points, ils
sont resynchronisés après 40, 80 et 120 répétitions.
Cette fonctionnalité est similaire au mode rafale, mais elle fonctionne en mode de signal continu.
Cette commande fonctionne également en mode balayage, rafale et modulation lorsque vous tentez
de synchroniser deux signaux arbitraires.

Les commandes FUNCtion:PULSe:DCYCle et FUNCtion:PULSe:WIDTh affectent le même paramètre.
Dans certaines applications, il est naturel de régler directement la largeur d'impulsion (en secondes) ;
dans d'autres, il semble plus logique de régler le rapport cyclique. Lorsque la fréquence est réglée, si
la largeur d'impulsion a été réglée plus récemment que le rapport cyclique sur la face avant, le rapport cyclique demeure constant lorsque la fréquence ou la période change. Cependant, si la largeur
d'impulsion était le dernier réglage, elle demeure constante lorsque la fréquence ou la période
change. Reportez-vous à la commande FUNCtion:PULSe:HOLD.
Le rapport cyclique de l'impulsion est défini comme suit :
Rapport cyclique = 100 x Largeur d'impulsion ÷ Période
La largeur d'impulsion est le temps qui s'écoule entre le niveau de 50 % du front montant et le niveau
de 50 % du front descendant suivant de l'impulsion.

l

l

Le rapport cyclique est compris entre 0 et 100 %. Cependant, le rapport cyclique est limité par la largeur d'impulsion minimale et le temps de front qui empêchent de le régler exactement sur 0 ou
100 %. Par exemple, pour une impulsion de 1 kHz, vous êtes généralement limité à des rapports
cycliques compris entre 0,002 et 99,998 %. Le rapport cyclique est limité par la largeur d'impulsion
minimale de 16 ns sur la série 33500, ou de 5 ns jusqu'à 4 Vpp et 8 ns jusqu'à 10 Vpp sur la
série 33600.
Restrictions basées sur la largeur d'impulsion : Le rapport cyclique spécifié pour une impulsion doit
respecter les conditions suivantes imposées par la largeur d'impulsion minimale. L'instrument règle
le rapport cyclique des impulsions afin qu'il soit compatible avec la période spécifiée. Sur l'interface
distante, l'erreur « Settings conflict » est également générée.
Rapport cyclique ≥ 100(Largeur d'impulsion minimale/Période)

l

l

Symétrie 100 %

Pour les rampes, la commande APPLy:RAMP remplace la symétrie active et sélectionne 100 100 %.
Pour définir une symétrie différente de 100 %, sélectionnez la sortie de la rampe avec la commande
FUNCtion RAMP, puis utilisez la commande FUNCtion:RAMP:SYMMetry pour configurer la symétrie.
La symétrie est conservée lorsque vous passez d'une rampe à une autre fonction. Lorsque vous revenez à la fonction rampe, la symétrie précédente est utilisée.
Lorsqu'une rampe est le signal modulant AM, FM, PM ou PWM, la symétrie ne s'applique pas.
L'instrument utilise toujours une rampe dotée d'une symétrie de 100 %.

319

Le rapport cyclique représente la durée par cycle pendant laquelle le signal carré est au niveau haut
(en supposant une polarité normale).
Pour les signaux carrés, la commande APPLy:SQUare remplace le rapport cyclique actif par la valeur
50 %. Pour configurer un rapport cyclique différent de 50 %, sélectionnez le signal carré avec la commande FUNCtion SQUare, puis utilisez la commande FUNCtion:SQUare:DCYCle.
Le rapport cyclique est conservé lorsque vous passez d'un signal carré à une autre fonction. Lorsque
vous revenez au signal carré, le rapport cyclique précédent est utilisé.
Limites imposées par la fréquence : Lorsque la fréquence augmente, les limites minimale et maximale
du rapport cyclique sont ajustées pour maintenir la largeur d'impulsion minimale à 16 ns (série
33500), 5 ns (série 33600 jusqu'à 4 Vpp) ou 8 ns (série 33600 jusqu'à 10 Vpp). Par exemple, à 1 MHz,
le rapport cyclique minimal sur la série 33500 est de 1,60 % et le rapport cyclique maximal est de
98,40 %. A 10 MHz, le rapport cyclique minimal est de 16,00 % et le rapport cyclique maximal de
84,00 %.
Si vous sélectionnez un signal carré comme signal modulant pour la modulation AM, FM, PM ou
PWM, l'instrument utilise toujours un signal carré avec un rapport cyclique de 50 %.

*RCL {0|1|2|3|4}
*SAV {0|1|2|3|4}
Rappelle (*RCL) ou enregistre (*SAV) l'état de l'instrument à un emplacement spécifié en mémoire non
volatile. L'état précédemment enregistré à cet emplacement est remplacé (aucune erreur n'est générée).
Pour les instruments série 33600, les fichiers de configuration associés à *SAV et *RCL
sont enregistrés dans des fichiers appelés STATE_0.STA à STATE_4.STA. Ces derniers
sont situés dans le répertoire Paramètres de la mémoire interne. Vous pouvez gérer ces
fichiers à l'aide des commandes MMEMory.

Paramètre
{0|1|2|3|4}

Renvoi type

Rappeler l'état à partir de l'emplacement 1 :
*RCL 1
l

l

l

l

L'instrument comporte 4 emplacements en mémoire non volatile pour l'enregistrement des états de
l'instrument. L'emplacement 0 conserve l'état de l'instrument à la coupure de l'alimentation. Utilisez
les emplacements 1, 2, 3 et 4 pour enregistrer d'autres états. Vous pouvez configurer l'instrument
pour rappeler l'état à la coupure de l'alimentation lorsque l'alimentation est rétablie
(MEM:STAT:REC:AUTO).
L'enregistrement de l'état « mémorise » la fonction sélectionnée (y compris les signaux arbitraires), la
fréquence, l'amplitude, la tension résiduelle CC, le rapport cyclique, la symétrie ainsi que les paramètres de modulation utilisés. Il mémorise également l'état de la face avant (DISP).
À la livraison de l'usine, les emplacements 1 à 4 sont vides et l'emplacement 0 contient l'état à la
mise sous tension.
À partir de l'interface distante SEULEMENT, vous pouvez utiliser l'emplacement 0 pour enregistrer un
cinquième état de l'instrument (vous ne pouvez pas sauvegarder cet emplacement à partir de la face
avant). Cependant, l'emplacement 0 est remplacé à la remise sous tension.

l

Vous pouvez attribuer un nom personnalisé à chacun des emplacements 0 à 4.

l

La commande *RST n'affecte pas les états enregistrés en mémoire.

333

Si vous supprimez un signal arbitraire en mémoire non volatile après avoir enregistré l'état de
l'instrument, les données du signal sont perdues et l'instrument n'envoie pas le signal lorsque l'état
est rappelé ; il envoie à la place l'état intégré « Croissance exponentielle ».
La face avant utilise le sous-système MMEMory pour l'enregistrement des états.

Pour activer des bits particuliers, spécifiez la valeur décimale correspondant à la somme binaire pondérée des bits du registre. Les bits sélectionnés sont ensuite récapitulés dans le bit 6 (Récapitulatif
général) du registre de l'octet d'état. Si l'un des bits sélectionnés passe de 0 à 1, l'instrument génère
un signal de demande de service.
La commande *CLS efface le registre des événements, mais pas le registre d'activation.
La commande *PSC (effacement de l'état à la mise sous tension) détermine si le registre d'activation
de l'octet d'état est effacé à la mise sous tension. Par exemple, la commande *PSC 0 conserve le
contenu du registre d'activation lorsque l'instrument est éteint puis rallumé.
La commande n'efface pas *RST le registre d'activation de l'octet d'état.

l

Un autotest est effectué à la mise sous tension de l'instrument et vérifie que ce dernier fonctionne correctement.
Un autotest complet (*TST?) dure environ 15 secondes. Si tous les tests sont réussis, vous avez
l'assurance que l'instrument est entièrement opérationnel.
La commande *TST affiche le message « Self-Test Passed » sur la face avant. Sinon, le message «
Self-Test Failed » et un numéro d'erreur sont affichés. Pour savoir comment contacter l'assistance ou
des instructions sur le retour de l'instrument à des fins de maintenance, reportez-vous à la section
Présentation des opérations d'entretien et de réparation.

Par exemple, vous pouvez utiliser cette option avec la commande *TRG pour vous assurer que
l'instrument est prêt pour un déclenchement :
*TRG;*WAI;*TRG

Registres
L'instrument utilise trois types de registres pour activer, repérer et suivre les caractéristiques de
l'instrument.
l

l

Un registre d'activation définit les bits du registre des événements qui seront reportés dans le groupe
du registre de l'octet d'état. Vous pouvez lire ou écrire dans un registre d'activation.
Un registre de condition surveille en permanence l'état de l'instrument. Les bits du registre de condition sont mis à jour en temps réel, et ne sont pas verrouillés ou placés en mémoire tampon.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

336

l

Un registre d'événements est un registre en lecture seule qui verrouille les divers événements du
registre de condition. Il n'existe pas de mémoire tampon dans ce registre ; lorsqu'un bit d'événement
est actif, les événements suivants correspondant à ce bit sont ignorés.

Sous-système INITiate
Le sous-système INITiate contrôle la manière dont l'instrument passe de l'état « veille » à l'état « attente
de déclenchement ». Vous pouvez faire cela pour une voie à la fois, ou les deux voies, avec le mot clé «
ALL ».
Exemple
Ce programme utilise la commande INITiate[1|2][:IMMediate] en association avec TRIGger[1|2]:SOURce
et TRIGger[1|2]:COUNt. La commande TRIG:SOUR EXT configure la voie pour le déclenchement externe
et la commande TRIG:COUNT définit le nombre de déclenchements à la valeur 10. La commande INITiate
place l'instrument à l'état d'attente de déclenchement. Le déclenchement se produit lorsque la ligne Ext
Trig de la face arrière reçoit une impulsion (haute par défaut). La voie retourne à l'état inactif après 10
déclenchements. Une autre commande INIT est nécessaire pour reprendre l'acceptation des déclenchements sur la ligne d'entrée de déclenchement externe.
INIT:CONT OFF
TRIG:SOUR EXT
TRIG:COUNT 10
INIT
INITiate[1|2]:CONTinuous {ON|1|OFF|0}
INITiate[1|2]:CONTinuous?
INITiate:CONTinuous:ALL {ON|1|OFF|0}
Indique si le système de déclenchement d'une voie ou des deux (ALL) retourne toujours à l'état d'attente
de déclenchement (ON) ou s'il demeure à l'état inactif (OFF) en ignorant les déclenchements jusqu'à ce
que la commande INITiate:IMMediate soit émise.
Paramètre
{ON|1|OFF|0}, ON par défaut

Renvoi type
0 (OFF) ou 1 (ON)

Configurer les deux voies pour un déclenchement continu :
INIT:CONT:ALL ON
l

l

Lorsque la voie est déclenchée, elle quitte l'état d'attente du déclenchement et passe dans l'état
« action en cours » (par ex., rafale en cours ou balayage en cours). L'état action en cours peut durer
quelque temps ; dans cet état, les déclenchements sont ignorés (non pris en compte dans le nombre
de déclenchements renvoyés par la commande TRIGger[1|2]:COUNt).
Avec la commande INIT:CONT ON, le nombre de déclenchements importe peu, car il n'existe aucun
moyen de distinguer la fin d'un nombre de déclenchements du premier déclenchement du nombre de
déclenchements suivant. Si vous souhaitez comptabiliser les déclenchements, vous devez exécuter la
commande INIT:CONT OFF.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

338

INITiate[1|2][:IMMediate]
INITiate[:IMMediate]:ALL
Fait passer le système de déclenchement des deux voies (ALL) de l'état inactif à l'état d'attente de déclenchement pour le nombre de déclenchements spécifié par la commande TRIGger[1|2]:COUNt.
l

Lorsque la voie est déclenchée, elle quitte l'état d'attente du déclenchement et passe dans l'état
« action en cours » (par ex., rafale en cours ou balayage en cours). L'état action en cours peut durer
quelque temps ; dans cet état, les déclenchements sont ignorés (non pris en compte dans le nombre
de déclenchements renvoyés par la commande TRIGger[1|2]:COUNt).
Paramètre

(aucun)

Renvoi type
(aucun)

Faire passer les deux voies à l'état d'attente de déclenchement :
INIT:IMM:ALL
l

l

l

339

La commande INITiate[:IMMediate] arme le système de déclenchement. Une fois le nombre de déclenchements atteint, le système de déclenchement retourne à l'état inactif et ignore les autres déclenchements. La fonction déclenchée demeure dans l'état atteint après le nombre de déclenchements.
Le réarmement du système de déclenchement avec une autre commande INITiate[:IMMediate] permet d'appliquer d'autres déclenchements.
Utilisez la commande ABORt pour ramener l'instrument à l'état inactif.
Si dans la voie spécifiée, la commande INIT:CONT est active (ON), les commandes INITiate[1|2]:IMMediate et INIT[:IMMediate]:ALL n'ont pas d'effet sur le système de déclenchement et l'erreur -213 est
générée.

Sous-système LIST
Configure la liste des fréquences que l'instrument doit envoyer. Cela permet des changements de fréquence plus rapides d'après une liste prédéterminée de fréquences. Vous pouvez faire progresser les fréquences par un déclenchement externe, interne ou un déclencheur BUS. La liste est lancée par la
commande FREQuency:MODE LIST.

LIST_DWELl - Définit la durée de chaque fréquence dans la liste.
LIST_FREQuency - Spécifie jusqu'à 128 fréquences dans une liste (les fréquences peuvent également
être lues ou enregistrées dans un fichier à l'aide des commandes MMEMory:LOAD:LIST[1|2] et MMEMory:STORe:LIST.

Formats des dossiers et des fichiers
De nombreuses commandes MMEMory font référence à des dossiers et à des fichiers. Leurs structures
particulières sont décrites ci-dessous.
Format d'un <dossier>
l

Le format d'un <dossier> est « <lecteur>:<chemin> », où <lecteur> peut être INTernal ou USB et <chemin> correspond au chemin d'accès complet au dossier.
l

INTernal spécifie le système de fichiers flash interne. USB désigne un périphérique de stockage
USB sur la face avant.

l

Les chemins d'accès absolus commencent par « \ » ou « / » au dossier racine <lecteur>.

l

Le nom de dossier spécifié dans <chemin> ne peut pas contenir plus de 240 caractères.

l

Le dossier spécifié doit exister, et ne peut pas être masqué ou un dossier système.

l

l

Si <lecteur>:<chemin> n'est pas indiqué, le dossier spécifié par la commande MMEMory:CDIRectory est utilisé.
Si <drive> n'est pas indiqué :
l

l

353

Le chemin d'accès est traité comme un chemin relatif et ajouté au dossier spécifié par la commande MMEMory:CDIRectory.
Les chemins absolus NE SONT PAS autorisés.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Format d'un <fichier>
l

Le format de <fichier1> et de <fichier2> est « [<lecteur>:<chemin>]<nom_fichier> », où <lecteur> peut
être INTernal ou USB, et <chemin> doit être le chemin d'accès complet au dossier.
l

l

INTernal spécifie le système de fichiers flash interne. USB désigne un périphérique de stockage
USB sur la face avant.
Si <lecteur>:<chemin> n'est pas indiqué, le dossier spécifié par la commande MMEMory:CDIRectory est utilisé.

l

Les chemins d'accès absolus commencent par « \ » ou « / » au dossier racine <lecteur>.

l

Les noms de dossiers et de fichiers ne peuvent pas contenir les caractères suivants : \ / : * ? " < > |

l

La combinaison du nom du dossier et du fichier ne peut pas contenir plus de 240 caractères.

l

l

l

Le fichier et le dossier d'origine et le dossier de destination doivent exister, et ne peuvent pas être
masqués ou des fichiers/dossiers système.
Si le fichier de destination existe, il est remplacé, sauf s'il est masqué ou s'il s'agit d'un fichier système.
Si <drive> n'est pas indiqué :
l

l

Le chemin d'accès est traité comme un chemin relatif et ajouté au dossier spécifié par la commande MMEMory:CDIRectory.
Les chemins absolus NE SONT PAS autorisés.

Mémoire de masse (MMEMory) et enregistrement de l'état
La face avant utilise le sous-système MMEM, et non le sous-système MEM, pour enregistrer les états. Si
vous enregistrez un état sur la face avant, vous pouvez néanmoins y accéder avec le langage SCPI.
Cependant, il n'est pas possible de récupérer à partir de la face avant un état enregistré dans le sous-système MEM via SCPI au moyen de la commande *SAV.
Par exemple, configurez l'instrument comme vous le souhaitez et introduisez une clé USB dans la face
avant. Entrez ensuite les commandes suivantes. Si vous n'avez pas de clé USB, modifiez « USB:\ » à «
INT:\ » pour utiliser la mémoire flash interne de l'instrument.
MMEMory:CDIRectory "USB:\"
MMEMory:MDIRerctory "States"
MMEMory:STORe:STATE "USB:\States\State1"
Pour retourner à cet état à tout moment :
MMEMory:LOAD:STATE "USB:\States\State1"
Vous pouvez également rappeler un fichier de configuration à partir du panneau avant en appuyant sur
[System] > Store/Recall.

Lorsque vous enregistrez un segment ou une séquence de signal arbitraire (MMEMory:STORe:DATA
[1|2]), les réglages actuels de l'instrument (tensions, fréquence d'échantillonnage, type de filtre, etc.)
sont enregistrés dans le fichier du segment ou de la séquence. Lorsque vous lisez le fichier pour la
première fois avec la commande FUNCtion:ARBitrary, ces paramètres sont chargés et remplacent les
réglages actuels de l'instrument. Si vous avez modifié manuellement le fichier d'un segment ou d'une
séquence en supprimant les paramètres de l'instrument, les réglages de l'instrument ne sont pas
modifiés lorsque vous exécutez la commande FUNCtion:ARBitrary.
Si le fichier de destination existe, il est remplacé, sauf s'il est masqué ou s'il s'agit d'un fichier système.
Si un fichier de séquence de signaux arbitraires (.seq) est spécifié, tous les noms des fichiers de segments de signaux arbitraires associés à la séquence sont enregistrés dans ce fichier.
La commande génère une erreur si le segment ou la séquence spécifié ne se trouve pas en mémoire
volatile.

MMEM:UPL? "INT:\Myfile.sta"

Sous-système OUTPut
Le sous-système OUTPut contrôle la sortie de la voie et les connecteurs Sync de la voie de la face avant,
ainsi que le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière :
l

OUTPut[1|2] {ON|1|OFF|0} - état du connecteur de sortie de la voie sur la face avant

l

OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD {<ohms>|INFinity|MINimum|MAXimum|DEFault} - impédance de sortie

l

OUTPut[1|2]:MODE {NORMal|GATed} - mode de sortie de la voie

l

OUTPut[1|2]:POLarity {NORMal|INVerted} - polarité du signal de sortie

l

OUTPut:SYNC {ON|1|OFF|0} - état du connecteur Sync de la face avant

l

OUTPut[1|2]:SYNC:MODE? - mode du signal de synchronisation

l

OUTPut[1|2]:SYNC:POLarity {NORMal|INVerted} - polarité du signal de synchronisation

l

OUTPut:SYNC:SOURce {CH1|CH2} - voie utilisée pour commander le signal de synchronisation

l

OUTPut:TRIGger {ON|1|OFF|0} - état du connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière

OUTPut[1|2] {ON|1|OFF|0}
OUTPut[1|2]?
Active/désactive le connecteur de sortie de la face avant.
Paramètre
{ON|1|OFF|0}, OFF par défaut

Renvoi type
0 (OFF) ou 1 (ON)

Active le connecteur de sortie de la voie 1 :
OUTP ON
l

l

l

l

l

365

Lorsque la sortie est activée, la touche de sortie de la voie de la face avant s'allume.
Les commandes APPLy remplacent le paramètre OUTPut actif et activent le connecteur de sortie de
la voie.
Si une tension externe trop élevée est appliquée au connecteur de sortie de la voie de la face avant,
un message d'erreur s'affiche et la sortie est désactivée. Pour réactiver la sortie, supprimez la surcharge sur le connecteur de sortie et activez la voie (OUTPut ON).
OUTPut change l'état du connecteur de sortie de la voie en commutant le relais de sortie, sans annuler la tension de sortie. Par conséquent, la sortie peut être instable pendant environ une milliseconde
jusqu'à ce que le signal se stabilise. Minimisez cette instabilité en minimisant d'abord l'amplitude
(VOLTage MIN) et en réglant la tension résiduelle à 0 (VOLTage:OFFSet 0) avant de modifier l'état de
la sortie.
Cette commande alterne également l'impédance de sortie entre 50 Ω (ON) et une impédance élevée

La valeur spécifiée est utilisée pour l'amplitude, la tension résiduelle et les niveaux haut/bas.
L'instrument comporte un ensemble constant d'impédances de sortie de 50 Ω sur les connecteurs de
la face avant. Si l'impédance de charge réelle diffère de la valeur spécifiée, l'amplitude et les niveaux
de décalage affichés seront incorrects. Le réglage de l'impédance de la charge est simplement un
moyen pratique de garantir que la tension affichée correspond à la charge attendue.
Si vous modifiez le réglage de l'impédance de sortie, l'amplitude de sortie, la tension résiduelle et les
niveaux haut/bas affichés sont ajustés (aucune erreur n'est générée). Si l'amplitude est de 10 Vpp et
si vous modifiez la terminaison de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance » (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF),
l'amplitude double pour atteindre 20 Vpp. Toute modification de la « haute impédance » à 50 Ω réduit
de moitié l'amplitude affichée. L'impédance de sortie n'affecte pas la tension de sortie réelle. Elle
modifie uniquement les valeurs affichées et récupérées de l'interface distante. La tension de sortie
réelle varie en fonction de la charge connectée.
Vous ne pouvez pas spécifier l'amplitude de sortie en dBm si la terminaison de sortie est réglée sur
une impédance élevée. Les unités sont automatiquement converties en Volts crête/crête (Vpp). Pour
plus d'informations, reportez-vous à la commande VOLT:UNIT.
Vous ne pouvez pas modifier l'impédance de sortie lorsque des limites de tension sont actives du fait
que l'instrument ne peut pas savoir à quelle impédance ces limites s'appliquent. Pour modifier
l'impédance de sortie, désactivez les limites de tension, configurez la nouvelle valeur d'impédance,
ajustez les limites de tension et réactivez-les.
Si INF (haute impédance) est sélectionné, la requête renvoie 9.9E+37.

Ce paramètre affecte uniquement la phase du signal arbitraire actuellement sélectionné. Pour
d'autres fonctions, reportez-vous à la section [SOURce[1|2]:]PHASe.
Ce paramètre affecte la phase du signal du signal arbitraire en mode continu normal, du mode de
modulation et du mode de balayage. En mode rafale, la phase du signal arbitraire est déterminée par
la commande [SOURce[1|2]BURSt:PHASe.
Lorsqu'un signal arbitraire est chargé en mémoire, sa phase initiale est égale à zéro ; il n'hérite pas de
la phase du signal arbitraire actuellement sélectionné. Chaque signal arbitraire conserve son propre
réglage de phase en mémoire.
La phase du signal arbitraire est définie par rapport à l'ensemble des points contenus dans
l'enregistrement des signaux arbitraires. Par exemple, le réglage de la phase du signal arbitraire sur
180 degrés sur un signal arbitraire de 64 échantillons entraîne une rotation de la lecture du signal de
sorte qu'il démarre (comme indiqué par le signal de synchronisation) au 33e échantillon et se termine

Avec la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par
exemple, si vous avez réglé la variation de fréquence sur 180 degrés, un niveau de signal +5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une variation de +180 degrés. Des signaux externes
plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs produisent une variation négative.

Lorsque vous sélectionnez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la fréquence devient la fréquence du signal arbitraire, qui est basée sur la fréquence d'échantillonnage et le nombre de points
présents dans le signal arbitraire.
Lorsque vous utilisez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la modification de ce paramètre
se répercute sur les métadonnées en mémoire cache représentant la fréquence d'échantillonnage du
signal arbitraire. Vous pouvez également modifier la fréquence modulante d'un signal arbitraire à
l'aide des commandes FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FREQuency, FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PERiod et FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe. Ces commandes et la commande de la fréquence de modulation sont directement couplées afin de maintenir exactement le même comportement du signal arbitraire que lors
de sa dernière lecture. Si vous désactivez ultérieurement la modulation et sélectionnez le même
signal arbitraire, sa fréquence d'échantillonnage (et la fréquence correspondante en fonction du
nombre de points) sera la même que lors de sa lecture comme source de modulation.
Si la fonction interne est TRIangle, UpRamp ou DnRamp, la fréquence maximale est limitée à 200 kHz
sur la série 33500 ou à 800 kHz sur la série 33600. Si la fonction interne est PRBS, la fréquence fait
référence au débit binaire et est limitée, comme indiqué ici.

AM : La profondeur de modulation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (ou le niveau de

De même, un signal modulant de -5 V (ou éventuellement de -1 V sur la série 33600) génère une
amplitude de sortie minimale.

(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si la variation de fréquence est de 100 kHz, un signal +5 V (éventuellement
de +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de fréquence de 100 kHz. Des signaux
externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs réduisent la fréquence au-dessous de la fréquence porteuse.
PM : Avec la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez réglé la variation de fréquence sur 180 degrés, un niveau de
signal +5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une variation de +180 degrés.
Des signaux externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs produisent une variation négative.
Impulsion comme fonction sélectionnée : La largeur d'impulsion ou la variation du rapport
cyclique des impulsions est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la
série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez
défini la variation de la largeur d'impulsion à 50 µs à l'aide de la commande PWM:DEViation, un
niveau de signal +5 V (éventuellement +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de
50 µs de la largeur. Des tensions externes inférieures produisent une variation inférieure.

Avec la source EXTernal, la phase (BPSK) ou la fréquence (FSK) de sortie est déterminée par le niveau
du signal sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Lorsque le niveau logique est bas, la phase ou
la fréquence porteuse est envoyée. Lorsque le niveau logique est haut, le déphasage ou la fréquence
de saut est envoyée.
La fréquence externe maximale BPSK est de 1 MHz et la fréquence maximale FSK, de 1 MHz.
Remarque : le connecteur utilisé pour les signaux BPSK ou FSK déclenchés extérieurement (Trig In)
n'est pas le même que celui utilisé pour les signaux modulés extérieurement AM, FM, PM et PWM
(Modulation In). Lorsqu'il est utilisé pour BPSK ou FSK, la polarité des fronts sur le connecteur Trig In
n'est pas réglable ; ce connecteur n'est pas affecté par la commande TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe.
Avec la source INTernal, la vitesse de commutation de la phase (BPSK) ou de la fréquence (FSKey) de
sortie entre la phase ou la fréquence porteuse et la phase ou la fréquence alternative est déterminée
par la vitesse BPSK (BPSK:INTernal:RATE) ou FSK (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).
Une voie ne peut pas être sa propre source de modulation.

Sous-système PWM
Le sous-système PWM permet d'exécuter la modulation de largeur des impulsions (PWM) sur un train
d'impulsions.
Exemple
Vous trouverez ci-dessous un récapitulatif des opérations nécessaires à la génération d'un signal PWM.
1. Configurer le signal porteur d'impulsions : Utilisez les commandes FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage
et VOLTage:OFFSet pour spécifier la fonction du signal, sa fréquence, son amplitude et sa tension résiduelle.
2. Sélectionnez la source de modulation (interne, externe, CH1 ou CH2) : PWM:SOURce. Pour une
source de modulation externe, ignorez les opérations 3 et 4.
3. Sélectionnez le signal modulant : PWM:INTernal:FUNCtion
4. Définissez la fréquence de modulation : PWM:INTernal:FREQuency
5. Définissez la variation de la largeur ou du rapport cyclique des impulsions : PWM:DEViation ou
PWM:DEViation:DCYCle
6. Activez la modulation PWM : PWM:STATe:ON

La variation est une variation ± ; si la largeur d'impulsion est égale à 10 ms et la variation à 4 ms, la largeur peut varier entre 6 et 14 ms.
La variation de la largeur d'impulsion ne peut pas être supérieure à la largeur d'impulsion actuelle, et
est également limitée par la largeur d'impulsion minimale (Wmin) :
Variation de largeur < Largeur d'impulsion – Wmin
et
Variation de largeur < Période – Largeur d'impulsion – Wmin

Le temps de front actif limite la variation de la largeur d'impulsion.
Variation de largeur < Largeur d'impulsion – (0,8 x Temps du front montant) – (0,8 x Temps

et
Variation de largeur < Période – Largeur d'impulsion – (0,8 x Temps du front montant) – (0,8

l

Si vous sélectionnez la source modulante externe (PWM:SOURce EXTernal), la variation est contrôlée
par le niveau de signal ±5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez réglé la variation de largeur sur 10 μs, un niveau
de signal +5 V (éventuellement +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une variation de 10 μs. Des tensions externes inférieures produisent une variation inférieure. Les signaux négatifs produisent des
variations négatives.

La largeur d'impulsion minimale (Wmin) limite également la variation du rapport cyclique :
Variation du rapport cyclique < Rapport cyclique – 100 x Wmin ÷ Période
et
Variation du rapport cyclique < 100 – Rapport cyclique – 100 x Wmin ÷ Période
où Wmin = 16 ns sur la série 33500 et 5 ns jusqu'à 4 Vpp ou 8 ns jusqu'à 10 Vpp sur la série

387

Avec la commande (PWM:SOURce EXTernal), la variation est contrôlée par le niveau signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière.
Par exemple, avec une variation du rapport cyclique de 5 %, un signal +5 V correspond à une variation
de 5 % (éventuellement +1 V sur la série 33600), soit une variation de la période de 5 % supplémentaires ajoutés au rapport cyclique des impulsions. Des signaux externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs réduisent le rapport cyclique.

Lorsque vous sélectionnez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la fréquence devient la fréquence du signal arbitraire, qui est basée sur la fréquence d'échantillonnage et le nombre de points
présents dans le signal arbitraire.
Lorsque vous utilisez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la modification de ce paramètre
se répercute sur les métadonnées en mémoire cache représentant la fréquence d'échantillonnage du
signal arbitraire. Vous pouvez également modifier la fréquence modulante d'un signal arbitraire à
l'aide des commandes FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FREQuency, FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PERiod et FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe. Ces commandes et la commande de la fréquence de modulation sont directement couplées afin de maintenir exactement le même comportement du signal arbitraire que lors
de sa dernière lecture. Si vous désactivez ultérieurement la modulation et sélectionnez le même
signal arbitraire, sa fréquence d'échantillonnage (et la fréquence correspondante en fonction du
nombre de points) sera la même que lors de sa lecture comme source de modulation.
Si la fonction interne est TRIangle, UpRamp ou DnRamp, la fréquence maximale est limitée à 200 kHz
sur la série 33500 ou à 800 kHz sur la série 33600. Si la fonction interne est PRBS, la fréquence fait
référence au débit binaire et est limitée, comme indiqué ici.

Si vous sélectionnez EXTernal, le signal porteur est modulé par un signal externe. En particulier :
l

l

l

AM : La profondeur de modulation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (ou le niveau de
signal ±1 V en option sur la série 33600) sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par
exemple, si la profondeur de modulation (AM[:DEPTh]) est de 100 %, lorsque le signal modulant
est à +5 V (ou éventuellement de +1 V sur la série 33600), l'amplitude de la sortie est maximale.
De même, un signal modulant de -5 V (ou éventuellement de -1 V sur la série 33600) génère une
amplitude de sortie minimale.
FM : Si vous sélectionnez la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si la variation de fréquence est de 100 kHz, un signal +5 V (éventuellement
de +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de fréquence de 100 kHz. Des signaux
externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs réduisent la fréquence au-dessous de la fréquence porteuse.
PM : Avec la source modulante externe, la variation est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V
(éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face
arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez réglé la variation de fréquence sur 180 degrés, un niveau de
signal +5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une variation de +180 degrés.
Des signaux externes plus faibles produisent une variation moindre et les signaux négatifs produisent une variation négative.
Impulsion comme fonction sélectionnée : La largeur d'impulsion ou la variation du rapport
cyclique des impulsions est contrôlée par le niveau de signal ±5 V (éventuellement ±1 V sur la
série 33600) présent sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par exemple, si vous avez
défini la variation de la largeur d'impulsion à 50 µs à l'aide de la commande PWM:DEViation, un
niveau de signal +5 V (éventuellement +1 V sur la série 33600) correspond à une augmentation de
50 µs de la largeur. Des tensions externes inférieures produisent une variation inférieure.

Avec la source EXTernal, la phase (BPSK) ou la fréquence (FSK) de sortie est déterminée par le niveau
du signal sur le connecteur Ext Trig de la face arrière. Lorsque le niveau logique est bas, la phase ou
la fréquence porteuse est envoyée. Lorsque le niveau logique est haut, le déphasage ou la fréquence
de saut est envoyée.
La fréquence externe maximale BPSK est de 1 MHz et la fréquence maximale FSK, de 1 MHz.
Remarque : le connecteur utilisé pour les signaux BPSK ou FSK déclenchés extérieurement (Trig In)
n'est pas le même que celui utilisé pour les signaux modulés extérieurement AM, FM, PM et PWM
(Modulation In). Lorsqu'il est utilisé pour BPSK ou FSK, la polarité des fronts sur le connecteur Trig In
n'est pas réglable ; ce connecteur n'est pas affecté par la commande TRIGger[1|2]:SLOPe.
Avec la source INTernal, la vitesse de commutation de la phase (BPSK) ou de la fréquence (FSKey) de
sortie entre la phase ou la fréquence porteuse et la phase ou la fréquence alternative est déterminée
par la vitesse BPSK (BPSK:INTernal:RATE) ou FSK (FSKey:INTernal:RATE).
Une voie ne peut pas être sa propre source de modulation.

la voie 2 sur 5 kéch/s. Toute modification de la fréquence d'échantillonnage d'une voie est reflétée
sur l'autre voie afin de conserver le couplage spécifié.
Si le couplage de la fréquence d'échantillonnage entraîne le dépassement des spécifications de fréquence d'échantillonnage pour les fonctions en cours, la commande provoque une erreur et la fréquence d'échantillonnage est définie à sa limite supérieure ou inférieure pour cette voie.

Sous-système ROSCillator
Le connecteur BNC d'entrée de référence 10 MHz situé sur la face arrière de l'instrument
est isolé jusqu'à ±42 V crête du châssis. Le boîtier de ce connecteur BNC est isolé du reste
de l'instrument. La circuiterie interne tentera de maintenir la tension isolée dans les
limites de ±42 V crête par rapport au châssis. Toute tentative de configuration de cette
entrée au-delà de ±42 V crête du châssis peut détruire l'instrument et provoquer des
risques de blessures graves, voire mortelles.

La sortie 10 MHz de l'instrument est reliée au châssis.

Le sous-système ROSCillator contrôle l'utilisation de l'oscillateur de référence 10 MHz de l'entrée de
l'oscillateur de référence externe. L'oscillateur de référence est l'horloge principale pour la synthèse de
tous les signaux. Tous les signaux sont verrouillés en phase par rapport à l'oscillateur de référence qui
contrôle donc la fréquence et la phase du signal de sortie.

ROSC:SOURce définit la commande ROSCillator:SOURce:AUTO sur OFF et ROSCillator:SOURce:AUTO ON
remplace ROSC:SOURce. La commande la plus récente (des deux) est prioritaire.
ROSCillator:SOURce INTernal utilise l'oscillateur interne de l'instrument comme oscillateur de référence.
Il peut s'agit d'un oscillateur à quartz à compensation de température (TCXO - Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator) ou d'un oscillateur à quartz thermostaté (OCXO - Ovenized Crystal Oscillator)
en option.
Pour savoir si l'oscillateur OCXO est installé, reportez-vous à la section *OPT?. Si un signal de référence
externe 10 MHz est présent sur le connecteur 10 MHz In de la face arrière, l'instrument utilise ce signal.
Une icône s'affiche dans l'angle supérieur droit de l'écran pour indiquer la modification de la source de

Présentation du sous-système STATus
Le système de l'état SCPI de l'instrument enregistre diverses conditions et états de l'instrument dans plusieurs groupes de registres.
Dans ce sous-système, un événement est un fait qui s'est produit, même s'il peut ne pas se reproduire.
Une condition est une situation existante. Une condition apparaît dans le registre des événements, mais
celui-ci est effacé (0) lorsqu'il est lu.
Les commandes STATus manipulent des bits dans deux des registres d'activation. Vous pouvez :
l

l

l

activer des bits dans le registre d'activation des données suspectes (STATus:QUEStionable:ENABle
<valeur_activation>). Requête : STATus:QUEStionable:ENABle?

Présentation du sous-système SUM
Le sous-système SUM ajoute un signal de source de modulation au signal principal d'une voie. Il permet
de générer un signal à deux fréquences porteuses sur une voie ou d'ajouter du bruit à un signal principal.
La fonction SUM utilise les mêmes sources secondaires que les sous-systèmes de modulation.
Une seule modulation ou fonction SUM peut être active sur une voie à un instant donné ; vous ne pouvez
donc pas ajouter du bruit à un signal FM à l'aide d'une seule voie. Pour ce fonctionnement, utilisez la commande COMBine:FEED qui groupe les deux voies d'un instrument 2 voies sur le connecteur de sortie
d'une voie.
Lorsque des signaux sont ajoutés :
l

l

Leur amplitude en crête ne peut pas être supérieure aux caractéristiques nominales de sortie de
l'instrument.
Aucune autre modulation interne ou externe n'est possible sur cette voie.

Vous pouvez configurer la phase entre le signal principal et le signal SUM en envoyant la commande
SOURce[1|2]:PHASe:SYNChronize après avoir configuré les fonctions du signal principal et du signal
SUM. Sinon, la phase entre les deux signaux est arbitraire.
Si la source est l'autre voie, on observe un retard significatif (pouvant atteindre 350 ns)
par rapport au signal porteur, même après PHAS:SYNC. Utilisez la fonction Combine pour
l'autre voie chaque fois que possible.

Exemple
Pour créer un signal SUM :
1. Configurez le signal porteur : Utilisez les commandes FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage et VOLTage:OFFSet pour spécifier la fonction du signal, sa fréquence, son amplitude et sa tension résiduelle.
2. Sélectionnez la source de somme : L'instrument accepte une source de modulation interne ou
externe (EXT, voie 1 ou voie 2). Sélectionnez la source de modulation à l'aide de la commande
SUM:SOURce. Pour une source de modulation externe, ignorez les opérations 3 et 4.
3. Configurez le signal de somme : Utilisez les commandes FUNCtion, FREQuency, VOLTage et VOLTage:OFFSet pour configurer le signal de somme.
4. Définissez le pourcentage d'amplitude à ajouter : SUM:AMPLitude.
5. Activez la modulation SUM : SUM:STATe:ON.
6. Si vous utilisez l'autre voie d'un instrument 2 voies, synchronisez les voies : PHASe:SYNChronize.

La sortie additionnée ne peut pas être supérieure la sortie maximale ±5 V (dans une charge de 50 Ω).
Si vous sélectionnez la source SUM externe (SUM:SOURce EXTernal), le signal porteur est ajouté au
signal externe. Le signal de somme est le signal ±5 V sur le connecteur (éventuellement ±1 V sur la
série 33600) sur le connecteur Modulation In de la face arrière. Par exemple, si l'amplitude d'un
signal porteur sinusoïdal est configurée avec 4 Vpp et si vous réglez l'amplitude de la somme sur
20 % (soit une contribution maximale de la somme égale à 800 mVpp) à l'aide de la commande
SUM:AMPLitude, lorsque le signal EXT est à +5 V (éventuellement +1 V sur la série 33600),
l'amplitude maximale de la sortie du signal additionné est égale à 4,8 Vpp. Lorsque le signal modulant est à -5 V (éventuellement -1 V sur la série 33600), l'amplitude minimale du signal additionné est
égale à -4,8 Vpp. Une entrée de modulation de 0 V entraîne un signal égal à l'amplitude du signal porteur.

Vous pouvez configurer la phase entre le signal principal et le signal SUM en envoyant la commande
SOURce[1|2]:PHASe:SYNChronize après avoir configuré les fonctions du signal principal et du signal
SUM. Sinon, la phase entre les deux signaux est arbitraire.
Lorsque vous sélectionnez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la fréquence devient la fréquence du signal arbitraire, qui est basée sur la fréquence d'échantillonnage et le nombre de points
présents dans le signal arbitraire.
Lorsque vous utilisez un signal arbitraire comme source modulante, la modification de ce paramètre
se répercute sur les métadonnées en mémoire cache représentant la fréquence d'échantillonnage du
signal arbitraire. Vous pouvez également modifier la fréquence modulante d'un signal arbitraire à
l'aide des commandes FUNCtion:ARBitrary:FREQuency, FUNCtion:ARBitrary:PERiod et FUNCtion:ARBitrary:SRATe. Ces commandes et la commande de la fréquence de modulation sont directement couplées afin de maintenir exactement le même comportement du signal arbitraire que lors
de sa dernière lecture. Si vous désactivez ultérieurement la modulation et sélectionnez le même
signal arbitraire, sa fréquence d'échantillonnage (et la fréquence correspondante en fonction du
nombre de points) sera la même que lors de sa lecture comme source de modulation.
Si la fonction interne est TRIangle, UpRamp ou DnRamp, la fréquence maximale est limitée à 200 kHz
sur la série 33500 ou à 800 kHz sur la série 33600. Si la fonction interne est PRBS, la fréquence fait
référence au débit binaire et est limitée, comme indiqué ici.

Configuration du réseau local
Configure l'instrument pour une utilisation à distance sur le réseau local (LAN).
L'instrument utilise le port 5024 du réseau local pour les sessions Telnet SCPI et le
port 5025 pour les sessions sur socket SCPI.
Notation par points

Les adresses notées par points (« nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn », où « nnn » représente la valeur d'un octet comprise
entre 0 et 255) doivent être exprimées avec soin du fait que la plupart des logiciels des PC interprètent les
octets avec des zéros initiaux comme des nombres en base 8. Par exemple, « 192.168.020.011 » est équivalent à la notation décimale « 192.168.16.9 », car « .020 » est interprété comme « 16 » en base 8 et « .011
» comme « 9 ». Pour éviter toute confusion, utilisez uniquement des valeurs décimales comprises entre 0
et 255 sans zéro au début.

Copie tous les paramètres d'une voie nommée dans l'autre voie avec les exceptions indiquées ci-dessous. Cela comprend les paramètres de liste des fréquences et tous les signaux arbitraires chargés en
mémoire.
Avec l'option INVerted, l'amplitude de la voie suivante est inversée pour former un signal similaire à
une sortie différentielle entre les voies 1 et 2. La tension résiduelle CC n'est pas inversée.
Lorsque l'option TRACk est activée (ON), les limites de tension sur les 2 voies s'appliquent. Si les
limites de tension sur une voie empêchent d'appliquer la configuration de l'autre voie, l'instrument
génère une erreur de conflit des paramètres et le suivi entre les voies demeure désactivé (OFF).
Lorsque l'option TRACk est activée (ON), les modifications d'une voie sont reflétées dans les deux
voies. Lorsque l'option TRACk passe de l'état ON ou INV à OFF, les voies conservent leur configuration actuelle (fréquence, amplitude, etc.), mais vous pouvez modifier une voie sans affecter
l'autre.
Les limites de tension peuvent être réglées en mode suivi, mais il n'est pas possible de les définir en
violation du signal actif.
L'activation du suivi (ON) provoque la définition de COMBine:FEED sur NONE, ainsi que la désactivation de FREQuency:COUPle, VOLTage:COUPle et de RATE:COUPle.

Le rapport entre la tension résiduelle et l'amplitude de sortie est illustré ci-dessous. Vmax est la tension de crête maximale compte tenu de l'impédance de sortie déclarée (soit 50 V pour une charge de
50 Ω ou 10 V pour une charge haute impédance).
|Voffset| < Vmax - Vpp/2
Si la tension résiduelle saisie est incorrecte, l'instrument la règle au niveau maximal autorisé avec
l'amplitude spécifiée. Sur l'interface distante, l'erreur « Data out of range » est également générée.

l

Différences entre l'utilisation de l'interface distante et de la face avant :
l

l

l

l

Interface distante : La définition de l'amplitude sur l'interface distante peut modifier la tension résiduelle pour obtenir l'amplitude souhaitée. L'instrument génère une erreur « Data out of range » ou
« Settings conflict ». Si la tension résiduelle n'est pas correcte, l'instrument la règle au niveau maximal autorisé avec l'amplitude spécifiée.
Face avant : La définition de l'amplitude sur la face avant ne modifie pas le réglage de la tension
résiduelle. Si l'amplitude spécifiée n'est pas correcte, l'instrument conserve l'amplitude maximale
autorisée avec la tension résiduelle actuelle et génère l'erreur « Data out of range ».

Limites imposées par l'impédance de sortie : Si l'amplitude est de 10 Vpp et si vous modifiez la terminaison de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance » (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF), l'amplitude double pour
atteindre 20 Vpp. Toute modification de la « haute impédance » à 50 Ω réduit de moitié l'amplitude
affichée. L'impédance de sortie n'affecte pas la tension de sortie réelle. Elle modifie uniquement les
valeurs affichées et récupérées de l'interface distante. La tension de sortie réelle varie en fonction de
la charge connectée.
Limites imposées par le couplage des sorties :
l

Différences entre l'utilisation de l'interface distante et de la face avant : Si 2 voies sont couplées,
les limitations sur les amplitudes de ces 2 voies sont vérifiées avant de modifier une amplitude. Si
une variation de l'amplitude de sortie est supérieure à une limite pour une voie, ou aux spécifications de sortie de l'instrument pour les deux voies :
l

l

Interface distante : L'instrument ajuste d'abord la tension résiduelle puis, si nécessaire,
l'amplitude de cette voie pour respecter les conditions limites ou les spécifications de tension.
L'instrument génère une erreur « Data out of range » ou « Settings conflict ».
Face avant : L'instrument adopte l'amplitude maximale avec la tension résiduelle active.
L'erreur « Data out of range » est générée.

Spécification des unités de tension : Vous pouvez spécifier l'amplitude de sortie en Vpp, Veff ou dBm
dans la commande VOLTage VOLT 3.0 VRMS.

Utilisez la commande VOLTage:UNIT pour spécifier les unités de sortie de toutes les commandes suivantes.
Vous ne pouvez pas spécifier l'amplitude de sortie en dBm si la terminaison de sortie est réglée sur une
impédance élevée. Les unités sont automatiquement converties en Volts crête/crête (Vpp).
l

l

l

l

l

Limites imposées par la sélection de l'unité : Les limites d'amplitude sont parfois déterminées par
l'unité de sortie sélectionnée. Cela peut se produire lorsque l'unité est Veff ou dBm en raison des différences entre les facteurs de crête de diverses fonctions. Par exemple, si vous modifiez un signal
carré 5 Vrms (dans une charge de 50 Ω) en signal sinusoïdal, l'instrument ajuste l'amplitude à 3,536
Veff (limite maximale Vrms pour un signal sinusoïdal). L'interface distante génère également une
erreur de conflit des paramètres.
Limitations concernant les signaux arbitraires : Pour les signaux arbitraires, l'amplitude est limitée si
les points du signal ne couvrent pas toute la plage du convertisseur N/A de sortie. Par exemple, le
signal intégré « Sinc » n'utilise pas la plage totale de valeurs ; son amplitude est donc limitée à 6,087
Vpp (dans une charge de 50 Ω).
La modification de l'amplitude peut interrompre brièvement la sortie à certaines tensions en raison de
la commutation de l'atténuateur de sortie. Néanmoins, l'amplitude est contrôlée de façon que la tension de sortie ne soit jamais supérieure au réglage actuel lorsque la commutation a lieu. Pour éviter
cette interruption, désactivez la détection automatique de la tension à l'aide de la commande VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO OFF. La commande APPLy active automatiquement la détection automatique.
Vous pouvez également régler l'amplitude (avec une tension résiduelle associée) en spécifiant un
niveau haut (VOLTage:HIGH) et un niveau bas (VOLTage:LOW). Par exemple, si vous réglez le niveau
haut sur +2 V et le niveau bas sur -3 V, l'amplitude résultante est de 5 Vpp avec une tension résiduelle de -500 mV.
Pour envoyer une tension continue, sélectionnez la fonction tension continue (CC - FUNCtion DC) et
réglez ensuite la tension résiduelle (VOLTage:OFFSet). Les valeurs acceptées sont comprises entre
±5 Vcc dans une charge de 50 Ω ou ±10 Vcc dans un circuit ouvert. Lorsque l'instrument est en
mode CC, le réglage de l'amplitude ne produit aucun effet.

l

Interface distante : La configuration du niveau haut ou bas à partir de l'interface distante peut
modifier le niveau haut ou bas pour obtenir le réglage souhaité. Dans ce cas, l'erreur « Data out of
range » ou « Settings conflict » s'affiche. Si le niveau haut est défini sous le niveau bas, l'instrument
configure le niveau bas 1 mV sous le niveau haut. Si le niveau bas est configuré sous la limite inférieure (LOW) ou des spécifications de sortie de l'instrument, le niveau bas est réglé sur la limite
inférieure (LOW) ou les spécifications de sortie de l'instrument et le niveau haut est défini à 1 mV
au-dessus du niveau bas. Un ensemble de règles similaires s'applique si le niveau bas est configuré incorrectement.
Face avant : La configuration du niveau haut ou bas sur la face avant peut rogner ce niveau pour
obtenir le niveau souhaité ; l'erreur « Data out of range » est générée. Il n'est pas possible de configurer un niveau haut inférieur au niveau bas sur la face avant.

La configuration des niveaux haut et bas entraîne également celle de l'amplitude et de la tension résiduelle du signal. Par exemple, si vous réglez le niveau haut sur +2 V et le niveau bas sur -3 V,
l'amplitude résultante est de 5 Vpp avec une tension résiduelle de -500 mV.
Limites imposées par l'impédance de sortie : Si l'amplitude est de 10 Vpp et si vous modifiez la terminaison de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance » (OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD INF), l'amplitude double pour

Limites imposées par VOLTage:LIMit:STATe : Si les limites de tension sont activées, les réglages de
tension sont vérifiés par rapport aux limites spécifiées (VOLTage:LIMit:HIGH, VOLTage:LIMit:LOW)

Pour que les limites de tension prennent effet, VOLTage:LIMit:STATe doit être activé (ON). Dans ce
cas et si la limite maximale est inférieure à la valeur haute du signal ou si la limite minimale est supérieure à la valeur basse du signal, la limite correspondante est rognée à la valeur haute ou basse du
signal. L'instrument génère une erreur « Data out of range » ou « Settings conflict ».
La limite supérieure règle la tension de sortie maximale autorisée en incluant la tension CC résiduelle
et l'amplitude en crête. Elle est réglée par rapport au paramètre OUTPUT[1|2]:LOAD actuel. Si
l'impédance de la charge spécifiée n'est pas présente sur la sortie de l'instrument, la limite sur la sortie ne représentera peut-être pas les tensions réelles sur le connecteur de sortie. Par exemple, si
l'impédance de sortie est configurée sur 50 Ω, mais si la charge réelle est en haute impédance, la tension réelle en crête peut être atteindre une valeur deux fois supérieure à la tension limite spécifiée.
Spécification des unités de tension : Vous pouvez spécifier la tension de sortie limite uniquement en
volts.
Lorsque VOLTage:COUPle[:STATe] et VOLTage:LIMit:STATe sont activés (ON), les limites de tension
sur les 2 voies affectent l'amplitude maximale et la tension résiduelle sur les 2 voies. La combinaison

Différences entre l'utilisation de l'interface distante et de la face avant :
l

l

l

l

Interface distante : Le réglage de la tension résiduelle sur l'interface distante peut provoquer une
modification de l'amplitude pour obtenir la tension résiduelle souhaitée. L'instrument génère une
erreur « Data out of range » ou « Settings conflict ».
Face avant : Le réglage de la tension résiduelle sur la face avant n'entraîne pas la modification de
l'amplitude pour obtenir la tension résiduelle désirée. Si la tension résiduelle spécifiée n'est pas
correcte, l'instrument conserve la tension résiduelle maximale autorisée avec l'amplitude actuelle
et génère l'erreur « Data out of range ».

Limites imposées par l'impédance de sortie : La plage de la tension résiduelle dépend de l'impédance
de sortie. Par exemple, si vous configurez une tension résiduelle de 100 mVcc et modifiez ensuite
l'impédance de sortie de 50 Ω à « haute impédance », la tension résiduelle affichée sur la face avant
est multipliée par deux et passe à 200 mVcc (aucune erreur générée). Si vous passez de « haute impédance » à 50 Ω, la tension résiduelle affichée est divisée par deux. Pour plus d'informations, reportezvous à la commande OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD. La modification de l'impédance de sortie n’a aucune répercussion sur la tension aux bornes de sortie de l'instrument. Seules les valeurs affichées sur la face
avant et les valeurs demandées sur l'interface distante sont modifiées. La tension sur la sortie de
l'instrument dépend de la charge connectée à l'instrument. Pour plus d'informations, reportez-vous à
la commande OUTPut[1|2]:LOAD.
Limites imposées par le couplage des sorties : Si deux voies sont couplées, les limitations de la tension résiduelle sont vérifiées sur ces voies avant qu'une modification ne soit apportée à la tension résiduelle. Si une variation de la tension résiduelle est supérieure à une limite ou aux spécifications de
sortie de l'instrument sur l'une des voies :
l

l

Interface distante : L'instrument ajuste d'abord l'amplitude puis, si nécessaire, la tension résiduelle de cette voie pour respecter les limites ou les spécifications de tension. L'instrument
génère une erreur « Data out of range » ou « Settings conflict ».
Face avant : La tension résiduelle est conservée à la valeur maximale autorisée qui ne doit pas
dépasser le réglage LIMit ; l'erreur « Data out of range » est générée.

Limitations concernant les signaux arbitraires : Pour les signaux arbitraires, l'amplitude est limitée si
les points du signal ne couvrent pas toute la plage du convertisseur N/A de sortie. Par exemple, le
signal intégré « Sinc » n'utilise pas la plage totale de valeurs ; son amplitude est donc limitée à 6,087
Vpp (dans une charge de 50 Ω).
La modification de l'amplitude peut interrompre brièvement la sortie à certaines tensions en raison de
la commutation de l'atténuateur de sortie. Néanmoins, l'amplitude est contrôlée de façon que la tension de sortie ne soit jamais supérieure au réglage actuel lorsque la commutation a lieu. Pour éviter
cette interruption, désactivez la détection automatique de la tension à l'aide de la commande VOLTage:RANGe:AUTO OFF. La commande APPLy active automatiquement la détection automatique.
La configuration des niveaux haut et bas entraîne également celle de l'amplitude et de la tension résiduelle du signal. Par exemple, si vous réglez le niveau haut sur +2 V et le niveau bas sur -3 V,
l'amplitude résultante est de 5 Vpp avec une tension résiduelle de -500 mV.
Pour envoyer une tension continue, sélectionnez la fonction tension continue (CC - FUNCtion DC) et
réglez ensuite la tension résiduelle (VOLTage:OFFSet). Les valeurs acceptées sont comprises entre
±5 Vcc dans une charge de 50 Ω ou ±10 Vcc dans un circuit ouvert. Lorsque l'instrument est en
mode CC, le réglage de l'amplitude ne produit aucun effet.

En mode par défaut, la détection automatique est activée et l'instrument sélectionne automatiquement les meilleurs réglages du générateur et de l'atténuateur du signal de sortie.
Lorsque la détection automatique est désactivée, l'instrument utilise les réglages actifs du gain et de
l'atténuateur.
La commande APPLy remplace le réglage de la détection automatique et active automatiquement la
détection automatique.
La désactivation de la détection automatique entraîne la suppression des interruptions momentanées
dues à la commutation de l'atténuateur pendant la modification de l'amplitude. Cependant, la précision et la résolution de l'amplitude et de la tension résiduelle (et la fidélité du signal) peuvent être
affectées si l'amplitude diminue au-dessous de la modification attendue de plage de réglage.
Si la commande VOLTage:COUPle[:STATe] est activée, la modification de ce réglage sur une voie est
répercutée sur les 2 voies.

L'instrument utilise la sélection en cours de l'unité pour les opérations sur la face avant et l'interface
distante. Par exemple, si vous sélectionnez « VRMS » sur l'interface distante (VOLTage:UNIT VRMS),
l'unité affichée sur la face avant est « VRMS ».
Cette commande s'applique aux résultats de la requête VOLTage?.
Il n'est pas possible de configurer l'unité de sortie de l'amplitude en dBm si l'impédance de sortie est
réglée sur « haute impédance ». Les unités sont automatiquement converties en Volts crête/crête
(Vpp).
Les suites de signaux arbitraires n'acceptent pas les unités Veff ou dBm.
À moins de spécifier l'unité dans la commande VOLTage ou l'une des commandes APPLy, la commande VOLTage:UNIT prévaut. Par exemple, si vous sélectionnez VOLTage:UNIT VRMS et ne précisez
pas d'unité avec une commande APPLy, l'<amplitude> de la commande APPLy est exprimée en « Veff

arbitraire à un autre. Le nouveau signal arbitraire adoptait les métadonnées du signal déjà en mémoire.
Par conséquent, un signal arbitraire conçu pour être lu à une plage de tension, une fréquence
d'échantillonnage et un filtre donnés (spécifiés dans les métadonnées du signal) était remplacé par un
autre ensemble de métadonnées. Après la version 1.12 du microprogramme, les signaux arbitraires
chargent toutes les métadonnées présentes dans le fichier de signal arbitraire afin qu'ils soient lus
comme auparavant.
Les signaux intégrés apportent peu ou pas de modifications lorsqu'ils sont chargés dans la mémoire des
signaux. Ils sont lus d'après la configuration actuelle de l'instrument. À titre d'exemple, reportez-vous au
début du fichier Haversine.arb illustré ci-dessous.

Du fait de l'absence de métadonnées, les paramètres actuels de plage de tension, de fréquence
d'échantillonnage et de filtre sont utilisés.

Réinitialisation de la configuration d'usine
Les tableaux suivants présentent les paramètres configurés par défaut en usine. Les paramètres signalés
par une puce (•) ne sont pas volatiles ; ils ne sont pas affectés par une remise sous tension ou l'exécution
de la commande *RST. Les autres paramètres sont volatiles et réinitialisés avec les valeurs indiquées à la
mise sous tension ou après l'exécution de la commande *RST.
La configuration à la mise sous tension ou après une réinitialisation peut être différente de celle indiquée ci-dessous si vous avez activé le mode de rappel de la
configuration à la mise sous tension dans le menu [System]. Reportez-vous à la

l

Il est possible d'enregistrer jusqu'à 20 erreurs de syntaxe de commande ou matérielles dans chaque
liste des erreurs des interfaces (une pour chaque erreur GPIB, USB, VXI-11 et Telnet/Sockets). Les
erreurs sont affichées dans la file d'erreurs de la session d'E/S ayant provoqué l'erreur.
L'instrument émet un signal sonore chaque fois qu'une erreur se produit (sauf si cette fonction est
désactivée par la commande SYSTem:BEEPer:STATe OFF). Le voyant ERROR de la face avant s'allume
si la file d'erreurs contient une ou plusieurs erreurs.
Une file d'erreurs globales spéciale contient toutes les erreurs matérielles et détectées à la mise sous
tension (par ex., température excessive).
Erreur de récupération « premier entré/premier sorti «» ; ces erreurs sont effacées après leur lecture.
Après la lecture de toutes les erreurs spécifiques aux interfaces, les erreurs figurant dans la liste globale sont récupérées. Une fois que vous avez lu toutes les erreurs de la liste globale des erreurs, le
voyant ERROR s'éteint.
Si plus de 20 erreurs se sont produites, la dernière erreur enregistrée (la plus récente) est remplacée
par -350,"Error queue overflow". Aucune erreur supplémentaire n'est enregistrée jusqu'à ce que vous
en supprimiez dans la file. Si aucune erreur ne s'est produite depuis la dernière consultation de la file
d’erreurs, l'instrument affiche le message suivant : +0,"No error".
La face avant signale les erreurs de toutes les sessions d'E/S et de la liste globale des erreurs. Pour
lire la liste des erreurs sur la face avant, appuyez sur la touche [System], puis sur la touche de fonction Help. Sélectionnez ensuite « Afficher la file d'erreurs de commande à distance » dans le menu
Help.
Les conditions d'erreur sont également récapitulées dans le registre d'octet d'état. Pour de plus
amples informations, reportez-vous à la section Présentation du sous-système STATus.
Les files d'erreurs propres à l'interface sont effacées lors des remises sous tension et de l'exécution
de la commande *CLS. La commande *RST n'efface pas la liste des erreurs.

Présentation de l'étalonnage - Série 33500
Ce chapitre décrit les procédures de vérification des performances et des réglages (étalonnage) de
l'instrument.

505

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Entretien et réparation - Introduction
L'instrument utilise une méthode d'étalonnage électronique en boîtier fermé ; aucun réglage mécanique
interne n'est nécessaire. L'instrument calcule les facteurs de correction en fonction des valeurs de référence en entrée que vous configurez et enregistre ces facteurs en mémoire non volatile jusqu'à
l'étalonnage suivant. L'extinction de l'instrument ou l'exécution de la commande *RST n'entraîne aucune
modification de ces données.

Présentation de l'étalonnage - Série 33500
Cette section présente les fonctions d'étalonnage de l'instrument. Pour des informations détaillées sur
l'étalonnage, reporetz-vous à la section Présentation de l'étalonnage.
Intervalle d'étalonnage
L'instrument doit être étalonné régulièrement à une fréquence qui dépend de la précision nécessaire à
votre application. Un intervalle d'un an convient à la plupart des applications. Les spécifications de précision sont garanties uniquement si l'étalonnage est effectué régulièrement. Au-delà d'un an, elles ne
sont plus garanties. Keysight Technologies recommande de ne pas laisser passer plus de 2 ans entre deux
étalonnages, quelle que soit l'application.

507

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Entretien et réparation - Introduction
Réglage recommandé
Quelle que soit la fréquence d'étalonnage choisie, Keysight Technologies recommande de procéder à un
réétalonnage complet au terme de cette durée. De cette manière, l'instrument conserve ses caractéristiques jusqu'à l'étalonnage suivant et offre une meilleure stabilité à long terme. Les caractéristiques
fonctionnelles mesurées avec cette méthode peuvent être utilisées pour prolonger la fréquence
d'étalonnage. Utilisez le nombre de points d'étalonnage pour vérifier que tous les réglages ont été effectués.
Temps nécessaire pour l'étalonnage
Pour la vérification d'un instrument reçu, effectuez d'abord les tests de vérification des performances.
Effectuez ensuite les réglages et exécutez à nouveau les tests de fonctionnement. Si elle est effectuée
manuellement, chaque opération dure environ 30 minutes par voie.
Vous pouvez également étalonner automatiquement l'instrument à l'aide d'un ordinateur. Avec un ordinateur, la procédure complète d'étalonnage et les tests de vérification des performances durent environ
30 minutes (une voie) ou 60 minutes (deux fois) lorsque l'instrument est préchauffé (voir Considérations
relatives aux tests).
Procédures d'étalonnage automatique
Vous pouvez utiliser un équipement de test programmable pour automatiser les procédures de vérification et de réglage. Vous pouvez programmer la configuration de chaque test de l'instrument sur
l'interface distante. Entrez ensuite les données vérifiées dans un programme de test et comparez les résultats à la limite de test correspondante.
Vous pouvez également régler l'instrument à partir de l'interface distante ; cette procédure est similaire à
celle qui est utilisée sur la face avant. Utilisez un ordinateur pour effectuer le réglage ; sélectionnez
d'abord la fonction et la plage désirées sur l'équipement de mesure. Envoyez la valeur d'étalonnage à
l'instrument et démarrez l'étalonnage sur l'interface distante.
Vous devez déverrouiller la sécurité de l'instrument avant l'étalonnage.
Séquence de programmation type pour une configuration d'étalonnage :
1. CAL:SETup 2 (configurer l'instrument pour l'opération d'étalonnage n°2)
2. Mesurer la fréquence de sortie avec le fréquencemètre externe
3. CAL:VALue 9.99994321E6 (envoyer la valeur mesurée à l'instrument)
4. CAL? (démarre l'étalonnage pour la configuration n°2)
5. Lire la valeur de la requête CAL? pour déterminer l'échec (+1) ou la réussite (+0) du réglage
6. CAL:SETup 3 (configure l'instrument pour l'opération d'étalonnage n°3)
Pour plus d'informations sur la programmation de l'instrument, reportez-vous à la section Présentation
du langage SCPI.

Nombre de points d'étalonnage
Vous pouvez interroger l'instrument afin de déterminer le nombre de points d'étalonnage effectués.
L'instrument a été étalonné en usine. À la réception de l'instrument, lisez le nombre de points
d'étalonnage pour déterminer sa valeur initiale.
l

l

Ce paramètre est non volatile ; il n'est pas modifié par une remise sous tension ou l'exécution de la
commande *RST.
Du fait que le nombre de points augmente d'une unité pour chaque point étalonné qui enregistre une
valeur, un étalonnage complet augmente ce nombre considérablement.

l

Face avant :
l

SCPI : CAL:COUNt?

Message d'étalonnage
Vous pouvez enregistrer un message contenant jusqu'à 40 caractères dans la mémoire d'étalonnage. Par
exemple, vous pouvez enregistrer la date du dernier étalonnage, celle à laquelle doit être effectué le prochain étalonnage, le numéro de série de l'instrument ou les coordonnées des techniciens d'étalonnage.
Déverrouillez la sécurité de l'instrument pour enregistrer un message d'étalonnage. Vous pouvez lire le
message d'étalonnage sur la face avant ou l'interface distante, que l'instrument soit ou non verrouillé.

Sécurité de l'étalonnage - Série 33500
Cette section décrit le système de sécurité de l'étalonnage de l'instrument.
Présentation de la sécurité
Un code de sécurité empêche les réglages accidentels ou non autorisés de l'instrument. Sur la série
33500, le code de sécurité par défaut configuré en usine varie selon le modèle :
Models

Code de sécurité

33521A et 33522A

l

l

Une fois que vous avez saisi un code de sécurité, vous devez l'utiliser pour les opérations sur la face
avant et l'interface distante. Si vous verrouillez l'instrument sur la face avant, vous devez utiliser ce
même code pour le déverrouiller à partir de l'interface distante.
Ce paramètre est non volatile ; il n'est pas modifié par une remise sous tension ou l'exécution de la
commande *RST.
Règles applicables aux codes de sécurité :

Déverrouillage de l'instrument sans code de sécurité
Avant de démarrer cette procédure, reportez-vous à la section Précautions contre les

décharges électrostatiques (ESD).
1. Débranchez le cordon d'alimentation, ainsi que toutes les connexions d'entrée et de sortie.
2. Démontez l'instrument (voir la section Démontage - Série 33500).

511

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Entretien et réparation - Introduction
3. Appliquez un court-circuit momentané entre les broches 1 et 6 du connecteur de la carte principale,
illustré ci-dessous.

4. Branchez le cordon d'alimentation et mettez l'instrument sous tension.
Veillez à ne pas toucher les connexions de l'alimentation ou les hautes tensions présentes sur le module d'alimentation. La tension d'alimentation est présente, même
si l'instrument est éteint.
5. La file des messages d'erreur affiche le message « Calibration security has been disabled ».
La sécurité de l'étalonnage est déverrouillée ; le mot de passe est alors rétabli à sa valeur par défaut
configurée en usine. Le nombre de points d'étalonnage augmente d'une unité, car le cavalier était
connecté pendant la mise sous tension ; le message d'erreur +701,"Calibration error; security defeated by hardware jumper" s'affiche. L'enregistrement de l'étalonnage en mémoire non volatile est mis
à jour pour tenir compte de ces opérations.
6. Éteignez l'instrument, enlevez le cavalier de court-circuit et le cordon d'alimentation.
7. Remontez l'instrument.
8. Entrez un nouveau code de sécurité (voir ci-dessus) et conservez ce code dans un endroit sûr.

Tests de vérification des performances - Série 33500
Ces tests permettent de vérifier les performances de mesure de l'instrument. Ils reposent sur les spécifications de l'instrument figurant dans la fiche technique du produit.
Il existe trois niveaux de tests de vérification des performances :
l

l

l

Autotest Ensemble de tests de vérification internes qui permettent de s'assurer que l'instrument fonctionne correctement.
Vérification rapide Combinaison des autotests internes et des tests de vérification sélectionnés.
Tests de vérification des performances Ensemble complet de tests recommandés comme test de
recette à la réception de l'instrument ou après avoir effectué des réglages.

Autotest
Un bref autotest de mise sous tension est effectué automatiquement à chaque mise sous tension de
l'instrument. Il certifie que l'instrument est opérationnel. Pour plus d'informations, reportez-vous à la section Procédures d'autotest.
Vérification rapide des performances
La vérification rapide des performances regroupe l'autotest et un test de performances réduit (spécifié
par la lettre Q dans les tests de vérification des performances). Ce test constitue une méthode simple de
vérification du fonctionnement de l'instrument et de respect des spécifications. Ces tests représentent
l'ensemble minimal de vérifications des performances recommandées après une intervention de maintenance. Le contrôle des performances de l'instrument pour les points de contrôle rapide (désignés par Q)
vérifie le fonctionnement des mécanismes normaux de dérive de la précision. Ce test ne vérifie pas les
défauts anormaux des composants.
Pour effectuer une vérification rapide des performances, procédez comme suit :

513

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Entretien et réparation - Introduction
1. Effectuez un autotest complet.
2. Effectuez uniquement les tests de vérification des performances indiqués par la lettre Q.
3. Si l'instrument échoue au contrôle rapide du fonctionnement, un réglage ou une réparation s'avèrent
nécessaires.
Tests de vérification des performances
Les tests de vérification des performances sont recommandés comme tests de recette technique lorsque
vous recevez initialement l'instrument. Les résultats des tests de recette doivent être comparés aux spécifications figurant dans la fiche technique du produit. Par la suite, vous devrez répéter les tests de vérification des performances à chaque intervalle d'étalonnage.
Si l'instrument échoue aux tests de vérification du fonctionnement, un réglage ou une réparation
s'avèrent nécessaires.
Un réglage est recommandé à chaque intervalle d'étalonnage. Si aucun réglage n'est effectué, vous
devez protéger la bande, sans aller au-delà de 80 % des spécifications répertoriées dans la fiche technique, que vous utiliserez comme limites de vérification.
Procédures de vérification de l'amplitude et de la planéité
Les procédures de vérification de la planéité utilisent un voltmètre CA de précision et un wattmètre. Vous
pouvez remplacer les convertisseurs de tension thermiques (TVC) pour effectuer des mesures par des procédures opérationnelles et un équipement de test appropriés.
Les mesures de planéité dans les plages -24 dB et -8 dB de l'atténuateur sont effectuées pendant la procédure de vérification. D'autres plages de l'atténuateur sont vérifiées dans le cadre des procédures de
vérification de la plage d'atténuation -24 dB et -8 dB. Il n'existe aucune procédure de vérification distincte pour ces plages.

521

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

Entretien et réparation - Introduction
1. Consultez la section Considérations relatives aux tests.
2. Effectuez les tests de vérification pour caractériser l'instrument (données entrantes).
3. Appuyez sur [System > Instr Setup > Calibrate. Si la sécurité de l'instrument pour l'étalonnage est
verrouillée, déverrouillez-la.
4. Entrez le numéro du réglage de la procédure en cours. Le numéro par défaut est « 1 » ; sur la face
avant, ce numéro est incrémenté à mesure que les procédures sont exécutées.
5. Sélectionnez BEGIN.
6. Pour les réglages qui nécessitent une entrée, réglez la valeur affichée avec la valeur mesurée et sélectionnez ENTER VALUE.
7. La configuration passe automatiquement à la valeur suivante nécessaire.
Pour annuler la procédure de réglage, sélectionnez CANCEL STEP. L'écran revient à la saisie du
numéro de réglage.
8. Lorsque vous avez terminé, sélectionnez END CAL.
9. (Option) Configurez un nouveau message d'étalonnage via l'interface distante. Ce message (contenant jusqu'à 40 caractères) est enregistré avec les cœfficients d'étalonnage.
10. Verrouillez la sécurité d'étalonnage du multimètre.
11. Notez le nouveau code de sécurité et le nombre de points d'étalonnage figurant dans les dossiers de
maintenance de l'instrument.

Rubrique d'étalonnage suivante

Abandon d'un étalonnage en cours - Série 33500
Il est parfois nécessaire d'abandonner un étalonnage en cours. Vous pouvez abandonner un étalonnage à
tout moment : mettez l'instrument hors tension ou, sur l'interface distante, envoyez un message
d'effacement de l'appareil suivi de la commande *RST.
L'instrument enregistre les constantes d'étalonnage à la fin de chaque procédure d'étalonnage. Si
l'alimentation est coupée ou si un réglage en cours est abandonné pour une raison quelconque, il suffit
d'exécuter à nouveau la procédure de réglage interrompue.
Si l'alimentation est coupée lorsque l'instrument écrit en mémoire de nouvelles
constantes d'étalonnage, vous pouvez perdre toutes les constantes d'étalonnage de
la fonction. Généralement, lorsque vous remettez l'instrument sous tension, celui-ci
génère l'erreur "-313, Calibration Memory Lost".

Réglage de l'amplitude CA (haute impédance) (voie 2) - Série 33500
L'instrument enregistre une constante d'étalonnage pour chaque voie de propagation vers l'atténuateur
haute impédance. Le cœfficient du gain de la propagation est calculé avec deux mesures : une avec le
convertisseur N/A du signal sur la sortie + et l'autre avec le convertisseur N/A sur la sortie –. Par conséquent, les réglages doivent être effectués deux par deux.

Présentation de l'étalonnage - Série 33600
Ce chapitre décrit les procédures de vérification des performances et des réglages (étalonnage) de
l'instrument.
L'instrument utilise une méthode d'étalonnage électronique en boîtier fermé ; aucun réglage mécanique
interne n'est nécessaire. L'instrument calcule les facteurs de correction en fonction des valeurs de référence en entrée que vous configurez et enregistre ces facteurs en mémoire non volatile jusqu'à
l'étalonnage suivant. L'extinction de l'instrument ou l'exécution de la commande *RST n'entraîne aucune
modification de ces données.

Rubrique d'étalonnage suivante

Présentation de l'étalonnage - Série 33600
Cette section présente les fonctions d'étalonnage de l'instrument. Pour des informations détaillées sur
l'étalonnage, reportez-vous à la section Présentation de l'étalonnage.
Intervalle d'étalonnage
L'instrument doit être étalonné régulièrement à une fréquence qui dépend de la précision nécessaire à
votre application. Un intervalle d'un an convient à la plupart des applications. Les spécifications de précision sont garanties uniquement si l'étalonnage est effectué régulièrement. Au-delà d'un an, elles ne
sont plus garanties. Keysight Technologies recommande de ne pas laisser passer plus de 2 ans entre deux
étalonnages, quelle que soit l'application.
Réglage recommandé
Quelle que soit la fréquence d'étalonnage choisie, Keysight Technologies recommande de procéder à un
réétalonnage complet au terme de cette durée. De cette manière, l'instrument conserve ses caractéristiques jusqu'à l'étalonnage suivant et offre une meilleure stabilité à long terme. Les caractéristiques
fonctionnelles mesurées avec cette méthode peuvent être utilisées pour prolonger la fréquence
d'étalonnage. Utilisez le nombre de points d'étalonnage pour vérifier que tous les réglages ont été effectués.

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

542

Entretien et réparation - Introduction
Temps nécessaire pour l'étalonnage
Pour la vérification d'un instrument reçu, effectuez d'abord les tests de vérification des performances.
Effectuez ensuite les réglages et exécutez à nouveau les tests de fonctionnement. Si elle est effectuée
manuellement, chaque opération dure environ 30 minutes par voie.
Vous pouvez également étalonner automatiquement l'instrument à l'aide d'un ordinateur. Avec un ordinateur, la procédure complète d'étalonnage et les tests de vérification des performances durent environ
30 minutes (une voie) ou 60 minutes (deux fois) lorsque l'instrument est préchauffé (voir Considérations
relatives aux tests).
Procédures d'étalonnage automatique
Vous pouvez utiliser un équipement de test programmable pour automatiser les procédures de vérification et de réglage. Vous pouvez programmer la configuration de chaque test de l'instrument sur
l'interface distante. Entrez ensuite les données vérifiées dans un programme de test et comparez les résultats à la limite de test correspondante.
Vous pouvez également régler l'instrument à partir de l'interface distante ; cette procédure est similaire à
celle qui est utilisée sur la face avant. Utilisez un ordinateur pour effectuer le réglage ; sélectionnez
d'abord la fonction et la plage désirées sur l'équipement de mesure. Envoyez la valeur d'étalonnage à
l'instrument et démarrez l'étalonnage sur l'interface distante.
Vous devez déverrouiller la sécurité de l'instrument avant l'étalonnage.
Séquence de programmation type pour une configuration d'étalonnage :
1. CAL:SETup 2 (configurer l'instrument pour l'opération d'étalonnage n°2)
2. Mesurer la fréquence de sortie avec le fréquencemètre externe
3. CAL:VALue 9.99994321E6 (envoyer la valeur mesurée à l'instrument)
4. CAL? (démarre l'étalonnage pour la configuration n°2)
5. Lire la valeur de la requête CAL? pour déterminer l'échec (+1) ou la réussite (+0) du réglage
6. CAL:SETup 3 (configure l'instrument pour l'opération d'étalonnage n°3)
Pour plus d'informations sur la programmation de l'instrument, reportez-vous à la section Présentation
du langage SCPI.
Matériel de test recommandé
L'équipement nécessaire aux tests de performances et aux procédures de réglage est répertorié ci-dessous. Si l'instrument recommandé est indisponible, vous pouvez le remplacer par un autre de précision
équivalente.

Nombre de points d'étalonnage
Vous pouvez interroger l'instrument afin de déterminer le nombre de points d'étalonnage effectués.
L'instrument a été étalonné en usine. À la réception de l'instrument, lisez le nombre de points
d'étalonnage pour déterminer sa valeur initiale.
l

l

Ce paramètre est non volatile ; il n'est pas modifié par une remise sous tension ou l'exécution de la
commande *RST.
Du fait que le nombre de points augmente d'une unité pour chaque point étalonné qui enregistre une
valeur, un étalonnage complet augmente ce nombre considérablement.

SCPI : CAL:COUNt?

Message d'étalonnage
Vous pouvez enregistrer un message contenant jusqu'à 40 caractères dans la mémoire d'étalonnage. Par
exemple, vous pouvez enregistrer la date du dernier étalonnage, celle à laquelle doit être effectué le prochain étalonnage, le numéro de série de l'instrument ou les coordonnées des techniciens d'étalonnage.
Déverrouillez la sécurité de l'instrument pour enregistrer un message d'étalonnage. Vous pouvez lire le
message d'étalonnage sur la face avant ou l'interface distante, que l'instrument soit ou non verrouillé.

Sécurité de l'étalonnage - Série 33600
Cette section décrit le système de sécurité de l'étalonnage de l'instrument.
Présentation de la sécurité
Un code de sécurité empêche les réglages accidentels ou non autorisés de l'instrument. Le code de sécurité par défaut configuré en usine pour les instruments de la série 33600 est AT33600.
l

l

l

Une fois que vous avez saisi un code de sécurité, vous devez l'utiliser pour les opérations sur la face

même code pour le déverrouiller à partir de l'interface distante.
Ce paramètre est non volatile ; il n'est pas modifié par une remise sous tension ou l'exécution de la
commande *RST.

3. Sur la série 33600, appliquez un court-circuit momentané entre les broches A1 et B1 de la carte à circuit imprimé de la face avant, comme indiqué ci-dessous.

4. Branchez le cordon d'alimentation et mettez l'instrument sous tension.
Veillez à ne pas toucher les connexions de l'alimentation ou les hautes tensions présentes sur le module d'alimentation. La tension d'alimentation est présente, même
si l'instrument est éteint.
5. La file des messages d'erreur affiche le message « Calibration security has been disabled ».
La sécurité de l'étalonnage est déverrouillée ; le mot de passe est alors rétabli à sa valeur par défaut
configurée en usine. Le nombre de points d'étalonnage augmente d'une unité, car le cavalier était
connecté pendant la mise sous tension ; le message d'erreur +701,"Calibration error; security defeated by hardware jumper" s'affiche. L'enregistrement de l'étalonnage en mémoire non volatile est mis
à jour pour tenir compte de ces opérations.
6. Éteignez l'instrument, enlevez le cavalier de court-circuit et le cordon d'alimentation.
7. Remontez l'instrument.

Tests de vérification des performances - Série 33600
Ces tests permettent de vérifier les performances de mesure de l'instrument. Ils reposent sur les spécifications de l'instrument figurant dans la fiche technique du produit.
Il existe trois niveaux de tests de vérification des performances :
l

l

l

Autotest Ensemble de tests de vérification internes qui permettent de s'assurer que l'instrument fonctionne correctement.
Vérification rapide Combinaison des autotests internes et des tests de vérification sélectionnés.
Tests de vérification des performances Ensemble complet de tests recommandés comme test de
recette à la réception de l'instrument ou après avoir effectué des réglages.

Autotest
Un bref autotest de mise sous tension est effectué automatiquement à chaque mise sous tension de
l'instrument. Il certifie que l'instrument est opérationnel. Pour plus d'informations, reportez-vous à la section Procédures d'autotest.
Vérification rapide des performances
La vérification rapide des performances regroupe l'autotest et un test de performances réduit (spécifié
par la lettre Q dans les tests de vérification des performances). Ce test constitue une méthode simple de
vérification du fonctionnement de l'instrument et de respect des spécifications. Ces tests représentent
l'ensemble minimal de vérifications des performances recommandées après une intervention de maintenance. Le contrôle des performances de l'instrument pour les points de contrôle rapide (désignés par Q)
vérifie le fonctionnement des mécanismes normaux de dérive de la précision. Ce test ne vérifie pas les
défauts anormaux des composants.
Pour effectuer une vérification rapide des performances, procédez comme suit :
1. Effectuez un autotest complet.
2. Effectuez uniquement les tests de vérification des performances indiqués par la lettre Q.
3. Si l'instrument échoue au contrôle rapide du fonctionnement, un réglage ou une réparation s'avèrent
nécessaires.
Tests de vérification des performances
Les tests de vérification des performances sont recommandés comme tests de recette technique lorsque
vous recevez initialement l'instrument. Les résultats des tests de recette doivent être comparés aux spé-

Keysight Trueform Series Operating and Service Guide

548

Entretien et réparation - Introduction
cifications figurant dans la fiche technique du produit. Par la suite, vous devrez répéter les tests de vérification des performances à chaque intervalle d'étalonnage.
Si l'instrument échoue aux tests de vérification du fonctionnement, un réglage ou une réparation
s'avèrent nécessaires.
Un réglage est recommandé à chaque intervalle d'étalonnage. Si aucun réglage n'est effectué, vous
devez protéger la bande, sans aller au-delà de 80 % des spécifications répertoriées dans la fiche technique, que vous utiliserez comme limites de vérification.
Procédures de vérification de l'amplitude et de la planéité
Les procédures de vérification de la planéité utilisent un voltmètre CA de précision et un wattmètre. Vous
pouvez remplacer les convertisseurs de tension thermiques (TVC) pour effectuer des mesures par des procédures opérationnelles et un équipement de test appropriés.
Le voltmètre CA de précision Fluke 5790A permet de mesurer l'amplitude entre 1 kHz et 20 MHz. Entre 20
et 120 MHz, un wattmètre équipé de la sonde de puissance N8482A est utilisé. Les mesures d'amplitude
des modèles 5790A et N8482A entre 1 MHz et 20 MHz sont utilisées pour adapter le modèle N8482A au
modèle 5790A.

Abandon d'un étalonnage en cours - Série 33600
Il est parfois nécessaire d'abandonner un étalonnage en cours. Vous pouvez abandonner un étalonnage à
tout moment : mettez l'instrument hors tension ou, sur l'interface distante, envoyez un message
d'effacement de l'appareil suivi de la commande *RST.
L'instrument enregistre les constantes d'étalonnage à la fin de chaque procédure d'étalonnage. Si
l'alimentation est coupée ou si un réglage en cours est abandonné pour une raison quelconque, il suffit
d'exécuter à nouveau la procédure de réglage interrompue.
Si l'alimentation est coupée lorsque l'instrument écrit en mémoire de nouvelles
constantes d'étalonnage, vous pouvez perdre toutes les constantes d'étalonnage de
la fonction. Généralement, lorsque vous remettez l'instrument sous tension, celui-ci
génère l'erreur "-313, Calibration Memory Lost".

Deux relais du bloc Commutation et filtres de sortie fournissent trois chemins au connecteur BNC de la
face avant (un filtre à passage direct et deux filtres à passage qui réduisent la distorsion de la sortie), ainsi
qu'un chemin ouvert pour désactiver la sortie. Une version atténuée de la sortie est transmise au convertisseur analogique/numérique de modulation en vue d'être utilisée pour l'autotest et l'étalonnage
internes.
Les relais de sortie sont contrôlés par le réseau FPGA. Deux circuits assurent la protection contre les surtensions et les surintensités, principalement à partir d'un circuit externe. L'instrument peut envoyer la sortie dans de très faibles impédances.

+3,3 V (isolées) doivent se produire.
Vérifiez également l'activité des broches 11, 12, 13 et 14 U601 (sur la carte mère) au démarrage. Notez
que cette activité cesse ou est instable lorsque l'instrument démarre.
En l'absence d'activité, l'erreur provient probablement de la carte mère.
Si les broches sont actives mais que la DEL DS401 ne s'allume toujours pas, l'erreur est probablement
due à un dysfonctionnement de la carte mezzanine.

Sortie 10 MHz
Si les alimentations fonctionnent et que l'autotest aboutit, vérifiez la sortie 10 MHz sur la face arrière.
Cette sortie est présente lorsque l'instrument est sous tension, et que la carte processeur et la carte mère
fonctionnent correctement. Si la sortie 10 MHz est présente, mais que l'écran ne fonctionne pas, examinez le montage de la face avant ou de l'écran.

Procédures d'autotest
Autotest à la mise sous tension
Chaque fois que l'instrument est mis sous tension, des autotests sont effectués pour vérifier que
l'ensemble minimal de circuits logiques et de sous-systèmes fonctionnent correctement.

Autotest complet
La réussite de l'autotest offre un niveau de confiance élevé dans le fonctionnement correct de l'appareil.
La procédure d'autotest active automatiquement l'oscillateur interne, les circuits numériques, la mémoire
des signaux et les chemins de propagation de l'atténuateur. Il essaie d'isoler les pannes dans un composant donné afin de faciliter la maintenance. Pendant le test, la(les) sortie(s) principale(s) de
l'instrument sont déconnectées en interne des connecteurs BNC et connectées au convertisseur analogique/numérique interne ; les niveaux des signaux des signaux dans l'instrument sont contrôlés.
Un autotest complet (*TST?) dure environ 15 secondes. Vous entendrez peut-être des commutations de
relais pendant le test. Lorsque l'autotest est terminé, le message « Autotest réussi » ou « Échec de
l'autotest » s'affiche sur la face avant. Les messages d'erreur de l'autotest sont décrits en détails ci-dessous.
Exécutez l'autotest avant toute vérification ou réglage.

Pour exécuter l'autotest
Supprimez toutes les connexions de l'instrument avant l'autotest. Remettez l'instrument sous tension
pour exécuter l'autotest à la mise sous tension.
À partir de l'interface distante
1. Connectez l'instrument à l'aide de l'interface distante (Configuration du réseau local).
2. Exécutez la commande *TST? et lisez le résultat : Réussite (+0) ou échec (+1). Utilisez la commande
SYSTem:ERRor? pour afficher les résultats.
À partir de la face avant
1. Appuyez sur [System] > Instr Setup > Self Test.
2. Une barre de progression s'affiche pendant l'exécution de l'autotest. À la fin, affichez les problèmes
rencontrés en appuyant sur [System] > Help, puis sélectionnez ensuite la rubrique Affichage de la file
d'attente des erreurs de l'interface de commande à distance.

Numéros et messages d'erreur des autotests (série 33500)
Une panne peut générer plusieurs messages d'erreur ; le premier doit être considéré comme la cause première de la panne. Certains messages d'erreur incluent un numéro de voie défectueuse (1 ou 2), indiqué
sous la forme n dans les messages ci-dessous.
