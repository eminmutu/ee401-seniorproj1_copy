Safety precautions
The following safety precautions should be observed before using this product and any associated instrumentation. Although
some instruments and accessories would normally be used with nonhazardous voltages, there are situations where hazardous
conditions may be present.
This product is intended for use by personnel who recognize shock hazards and are familiar with the safety precautions required
to avoid possible injury. Read and follow all installation, operation, and maintenance information carefully before using the
product. Refer to the user documentation for complete product specifications.
If the product is used in a manner not specified, the protection provided by the product warranty may be impaired.
The types of product users are:
Responsible body is the individual or group responsible for the use and maintenance of equipment, for ensuring that the
equipment is operated within its specifications and operating limits, and for ensuring that operators are adequately trained.
Operators use the product for its intended function. They must be trained in electrical safety procedures and proper use of the
instrument. They must be protected from electric shock and contact with hazardous live circuits.
Maintenance personnel perform routine procedures on the product to keep it operating properly, for example, setting the line
voltage or replacing consumable materials. Maintenance procedures are described in the user documentation. The procedures
explicitly state if the operator may perform them. Otherwise, they should be performed only by service personnel.
Service personnel are trained to work on live circuits, perform safe installations, and repair products. Only properly trained
service personnel may perform installation and service procedures.
Keithley products are designed for use with electrical signals that are measurement, control, and data I/O connections, with low
transient overvoltages, and must not be directly connected to mains voltage or to voltage sources with high transient
overvoltages. Measurement Category II (as referenced in IEC 60664) connections require protection for high transient
overvoltages often associated with local AC mains connections. Certain Keithley measuring instruments may be connected to
mains. These instruments will be marked as category II or higher.
Unless explicitly allowed in the specifications, operating manual, and instrument labels, do not connect any instrument to mains.
Exercise extreme caution when a shock hazard is present. Lethal voltage may be present on cable connector jacks or test
fixtures. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) states that a shock hazard exists when voltage levels greater than
30 V RMS, 42.4 V peak, or 60 VDC are present. A good safety practice is to expect that hazardous voltage is present in any
unknown circuit before measuring.
Operators of this product must be protected from electric shock at all times. The responsible body must ensure that operators
are prevented access and/or insulated from every connection point. In some cases, connections must be exposed to potential
human contact. Product operators in these circumstances must be trained to protect themselves from the risk of electric shock. If
the circuit is capable of operating at or above 1000 V, no conductive part of the circuit may be exposed.
Do not connect switching cards directly to unlimited power circuits. They are intended to be used with impedance-limited
sources. NEVER connect switching cards directly to AC mains. When connecting sources to switching cards, install protective
devices to limit fault current and voltage to the card.
Before operating an instrument, ensure that the line cord is connected to a properly-grounded power receptacle. Inspect the
connecting cables, test leads, and jumpers for possible wear, cracks, or breaks before each use.
When installing equipment where access to the main power cord is restricted, such as rack mounting, a separate main input
power disconnect device must be provided in close proximity to the equipment and within easy reach of the operator.
For maximum safety, do not touch the product, test cables, or any other instruments while power is applied to the circuit under
test. ALWAYS remove power from the entire test system and discharge any capacitors before: connecting or disconnecting
cables or jumpers, installing or removing switching cards, or making internal changes, such as installing or removing jumpers.
Do not touch any object that could provide a current path to the common side of the circuit under test or power line (earth)
ground. Always make measurements with dry hands while standing on a dry, insulated surface capable of withstanding the
voltage being measured.

For safety, instruments and accessories must be used in accordance with the operating instructions. If the instruments or
accessories are used in a manner not specified in the operating instructions, the protection provided by the equipment may be
impaired.
Do not exceed the maximum signal levels of the instruments and accessories. Maximum signal levels are defined in the
specifications and operating information and shown on the instrument panels, test fixture panels, and switching cards.
When fuses are used in a product, replace with the same type and rating for continued protection against fire hazard.
Chassis connections must only be used as shield connections for measuring circuits, NOT as protective earth (safety ground)
connections.
If you are using a test fixture, keep the lid closed while power is applied to the device under test. Safe operation requires the use
of a lid interlock.
If a

screw is present, connect it to protective earth (safety ground) using the wire recommended in the user documentation.

The
symbol on an instrument means caution, risk of hazard. The user must refer to the operating instructions located in the
user documentation in all cases where the symbol is marked on the instrument.
The
symbol on an instrument means warning, risk of electric shock. Use standard safety precautions to avoid personal
contact with these voltages.
The
The

symbol on an instrument shows that the surface may be hot. Avoid personal contact to prevent burns.
symbol indicates a connection terminal to the equipment frame.

If this
symbol is on a product, it indicates that mercury is present in the display lamp. Please note that the lamp must be
properly disposed of according to federal, state, and local laws.
The WARNING heading in the user documentation explains hazards that might result in personal injury or death. Always read
the associated information very carefully before performing the indicated procedure.
The CAUTION heading in the user documentation explains hazards that could damage the instrument. Such damage may
invalidate the warranty.
The CAUTION heading with the
symbol in the user documentation explains hazards that could result in moderate or minor
injury or damage the instrument. Always read the associated information very carefully before performing the indicated
procedure. Damage to the instrument may invalidate the warranty.
Instrumentation and accessories shall not be connected to humans.
Before performing any maintenance, disconnect the line cord and all test cables.
To maintain protection from electric shock and fire, replacement components in mains circuits — including the power
transformer, test leads, and input jacks — must be purchased from Keithley. Standard fuses with applicable national safety
approvals may be used if the rating and type are the same. The detachable mains power cord provided with the instrument may
only be replaced with a similarly rated power cord. Other components that are not safety-related may be purchased from other
suppliers as long as they are equivalent to the original component (note that selected parts should be purchased only through
Keithley to maintain accuracy and functionality of the product). If you are unsure about the applicability of a replacement
component, call a Keithley office for information.
Unless otherwise noted in product-specific literature, Keithley instruments are designed to operate indoors only, in the following
environment: Altitude at or below 2,000 m (6,562 ft); temperature 0 °C to 50 °C (32 °F to 122 °F); and pollution degree 1 or 2.
To clean an instrument, use a cloth dampened with deionized water or mild, water-based cleaner. Clean the exterior of the
instrument only. Do not apply cleaner directly to the instrument or allow liquids to enter or spill on the instrument. Products that
consist of a circuit board with no case or chassis (e.g., a data acquisition board for installation into a computer) should never
require cleaning if handled according to instructions. If the board becomes contaminated and operation is affected, the board
should be returned to the factory for proper cleaning/servicing.

LabVIEW Software.

•

Keithley I/O layer: Manages the communications between Keithley instrument drivers and
software applications and the instrument itself. The I/O Layer handles differences in
communications required to support GPIB, serial, ethernet, and other communications buses so
that drivers and software applications do not need to handle the differences themselves.

To identify IP addresses of instruments that are connected to the local area network (LAN) and
support the VXI-11 discovery protocol, you can also use LXI Discovery Tool, available from the
Resources (lxistandard.org/Resources/Resources.aspx) page of the LXI Consortium website
(lxistandard.org).

Basic operation
For the Models 2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2635B, and 2636B, hazardous voltages may be
present on all output and guard terminals. To prevent electrical shock that could cause injury
or death, never make or break connections to the 2600B while the instrument is powered on.
Turn off the equipment from the front panel or disconnect the main power cord from the rear
of the 2600B before handling cables. Putting the equipment into standby does not guarantee
that the outputs are powered off if a hardware or software fault occurs.

See the following topics for detailed information.

Source V
When configured to source voltage (V-source) as shown in the following figure, the 2600B functions
as a low-impedance voltage source with current limit capability and can measure current (I-meter) or
voltage (V-meter).
Sense circuitry is used to monitor the output voltage continuously and make adjustments to the
V-source as needed. The V-meter senses the voltage at the HI / LO terminals (2-wire local sense) or
at the device under test (DUT) (4-wire remote sense using the sense terminals) and compares it to
the programmed voltage level. If the sensed level and the programmed value are not the same, the
V-source is adjusted accordingly. Remote sense eliminates the effect of voltage drops in the test
leads, ensuring that the exact programmed voltage appears at the DUT. With 4-wire sensing enabled,
both remote sense leads must be connected or incorrect operation occurs. For the 2601B, 2602B,
2611B, 2612B, 2635B, and 2636B, use contact check to verify that the sense leads are connected
(see Contact check measurements (on page 2-22)).

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Figure 3: Source V configuration

Source I
When the instrument is configured to source current (I-source), as shown in the figure below, the
instrument functions as a high-impedance current source with voltage limit capability and can
measure current (I-meter) or voltage (V-meter).
For 2-wire local sensing, voltage is measured at the HI / LO terminals of the instrument. For 4-wire
remote sensing, voltage is measured directly at the device-under-test (DUT) using the sense
terminals. This eliminates any voltage drops that may be in the test leads or connections between the
instrument and the DUT.
The current source does not require or use the sense leads to enhance current source accuracy.
However, if the instrument is in 4-wire remote sense mode, the instrument may reach limit levels if the
sense leads are disconnected. With 4-wire remote sensing selected, the sense leads must be
connected or incorrect operation results.

Section 2: Sourcing and measuring

Figure 4: Source I configuration

Source I measure I, source V measure V
The System SourceMeter® instrument can measure the same function that it is sourcing. For example,
when sourcing a voltage, you can measure voltage. Conversely, if you are sourcing current, you can
measure the output current. For these operations, the measure range is the same as the source
range.
This feature is valuable when operating with the source in compliance. When in compliance, the
programmed source value is not reached, so measuring the source lets you measure the actual
output level.

Measure only (voltage or current)
The figures below show the configurations for using the instrument exclusively as a voltmeter or
ammeter.
As shown in the following figure, to configure the instrument to measure voltage only, set it to source
0 A and measure voltage.
Figure 5: 2600B measure voltage only

Set the voltage limit to a level that is higher than the measured voltage. If the voltage limit is
set to a level that is lower than the measured voltage, excessive current flows into the
instrument. This current could damage the instrument. Also, when connecting an external
energy source to the instrument when it is configured as a current source, set the output off
state to the high-impedance mode. See Output-off states (on page 2-40) for more information
on the output-off states. See “Limits” in the Series 2600B User's Manual for details on
compliance limits.

In the following figure, the instrument uses a 2-wire local sensing configuration and is set to measure
current only by setting it to source 0 V and measure current. Note that to obtain positive (+) readings,
conventional current must flow from HI to LO.

Contact check
The Models 2604B, 2614B, and 2634B do not perform contact check measurements.
When a contact check measurement is made, two small current sources switch between the HI and
SENSE HI terminals and the LO and SENSE LO terminals. By controlling the switches illustrated in
the following figure, the current from these sources flows through the test leads and through the
contact resistance, as shown. To accurately measure the resulting contact resistance, the differential
amplifier outputs are measured once with the current sources connected, and again with the current
sources disconnected. This allows for compensation of various offset voltages that can occur.

Operation considerations for the ADC
The following paragraphs discuss autozero and NPLC caching with the analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) (on page 5-24).

Autozero
The ADC of the 2600B uses a ratiometric analog to digital (A/D) conversion technique. To ensure
reading accuracy, the instrument must periodically obtain fresh measurements of its internal ground
and voltage reference. Separate reference and zero measurements are used for each aperture.
As summarized in the table below, there are different settings for autozero. By default, the instrument
is set to AUTO, which automatically checks these reference measurements whenever a signal
measurement is made. If the reference measurements are out of date when a signal measurement is
made, the instrument automatically makes two more A/D conversions, one for the reference and one
for the zero, before returning the result. Thus, occasionally, a measurement takes longer than normal.
This extra time can cause problems in sweeps and other test sequences in which measurement
timing is critical. To avoid the extra time for the reference measurements in these situations, you can
select OFF. This setting disables the automatic reference measurements. Note that with automatic
reference measurements disabled, the instrument may gradually drift out of specification.
To minimize the drift, make a reference and zero measurement immediately before a critical test
sequence. You can use the ONCE setting to force a refresh of the reference and zero measurements
used for the current aperture setting.

To set autozero from a remote interface:
Use the autozero command with the appropriate option shown in the following table to set autozero
through a remote interface (see smuX.measure.autozero (on page 9-218)). For example, send the

* smuX can be smua for channel A or smub for channel B

NPLC caching
NPLC caching speeds up operation by caching A/D reference and zero values for up to the ten most
recent measurement aperture settings. Whenever the integration rate is changed using the SPEED
key, or a user setup is recalled, the NPLC cache is checked. If the integration rate is already stored in
the cache, the stored reference and zero values are recalled and used. If the integration rate is not
already stored in the cache, a reference and zero value is acquired and stored in the cache when the
next measurement is made. If there are already ten NPLC values stored, the oldest one is overwritten
by the newest one. When autozero is off, NPLC values stored in the cache are used,
regardless of age.

Voltmeter and ammeter measurements
You can make voltmeter and ammeter measurements without using the MODE key, such as when
configuring measure-only tests over the remote interface.
To use the 2600B to measure voltage or current:
1. Select the source-measure functions:
▪

Voltmeter: Press the SRC key to select the current source and press the MEAS key to select
the voltage measurement function.

▪

Ammeter: Press the SRC key to select the voltage source and press the MEAS key to select
the current measurement function.

2. Set source and compliance levels. To edit the source level, use the procedure provided in Step 1:
Select and set the source level; to edit the compliance level, use the procedure provided in Step 2:
Set the compliance limit:
▪

Select the lowest source range and set the source level to zero.

▪

Set the compliance level to a value that is higher than the expected measurement.

When using the 2600B as a voltmeter, the voltage compliance limit must be set higher than
the voltage that is being measured. Failure to do this could result in excessive current flow
into the 2600B, incorrect measurements, and possible damage to the instrument.

3. Use the RANGE keys to select a fixed measurement range that accommodates the expected
reading. Use the lowest possible range for best accuracy. You can also select autorange, which
automatically sets the 2600B to the most sensitive range.
4. Connect the voltage or current to be measured. Make sure to use 2-wire connections from the
2600B to the device under test (DUT) (see “DUT test connections” in the Series 2600B User's

Ohms measurements
Resistance readings are calculated from the measured current and measured voltage as follows:
R = V/I
Where:

•

R is the calculated resistance

•

V is the measured voltage

•

I is the measured current

Ohms ranging
The front-panel ohms function does not use ranging. The instrument formats a calculated resistance
reading (V/I) to best fit the display. There may be leading zeros if the ohms reading is less than 1 mΩ.

Basic ohms measurement procedure
When you use the MODE key to select ohms measurement, the 2600B is automatically configured as
a current source with a level of 1 mA. To change the source function, source value, or compliance
value (in other words, customize the standard ohmmeter configuration of the MODE key), then use
the following steps to make ohms measurements. The following procedure assumes that the 2600B is
already connected to the device under test (see “DUT test connections” in the Series 2600B User's
Manual).
The following procedure requires dual-channel instruments (2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B,
and 2636B) to be placed in single-channel display mode. For these models, press the DISPLAY key
to select single-channel display mode. See “Display mode” in the Series 2600B User's Manual.

of 2-wire resistance measurements, particularly with lower resistance values.

The 4-wire sensing method, as shown in the following figure (4-wire resistance sensing), minimizes or
eliminates the effects of lead resistance by measuring the voltage across the resistor under test with a

following steps to make power measurements. The following procedure assumes that the 2600B is
already connected to the device under test (DUT) as explained in “DUT test connections” in the
Series 2600B User's Manual.

Hazardous voltages may be present on all output and guard terminals. To prevent electrical
shock that could cause injury or death, never make or break connections to the 2600B while
the output is on. Turn off the equipment from the front panel or disconnect the main power
cord from the rear of the 2600B before handling cables. Putting the equipment into an

Contact check measurements
The Models 2604B, 2614B, and 2634B do not perform contact check measurements.
The contact check function prevents measurements that may be in error due to excessive resistance
in the force or sense leads when making remotely sensed (Kelvin) measurements. Potential sources
for this resistance include poor contact at the device under test (DUT), failing relay contacts on a
switching card, and wires that are too long or thin. To use contact check, the current limit must be at
least 1 mA (this allows enough current to flow when performing the test), and the source-measure unit
(SMU) must not be in High-Z output-off mode.
The contact check function also detects an open circuit that may occur when a four-point probe is
misplaced or misaligned. This relationship is shown schematically in the figure below, where R C is the
resistance of the mechanical contact at the DUT, and RS is the series resistance of relays and cables.
Figure 11: Contact check measurements

When the source is off, smuX.source.offmode is set to smuX.OUTPUT_ZERO, and the effective
current limit is less than 1 mA, contact check operations result in error code 5066,
source.offlimiti too low for contact check. In the zero off mode,
smuX.source.offlimiti is ignored and the effective current limit depends on what the channel is
sourcing when it is turned off. If the channel is sourcing:

•

Voltage: The current limit is determined by smuX.source.limiti.

•

Current: The current limit is determined by the greater of smuX.source.leveli or 10 percent
of smuX.source.rangei.

Multiple SMU connections
Connections to LO on the 2600B are not necessarily at 0 V. Hazardous voltages could exist
between LO and chassis ground. Make sure that high-voltage precautions are taken
throughout the test system. Alternatively, limit hazardous levels by adding external
protection to limit the voltage between LO and chassis. Failure to make sure high-voltage
precautions are used throughout the test system or a failure to limit hazardous levels could
result in severe personal injury or death from electric shock.

Carefully consider and configure the appropriate output-off state, source function, and
compliance limits before connecting the 2600B to a device that can deliver energy (for
example, other voltage sources, batteries, capacitors, solar cells, or other 2600B
instruments). Configure recommended instrument settings before making connections to the
device. Failure to consider the output-off state, source, and compliance limits may result in
damage to the instrument or to the device under test (DUT).
The following figures show how to use the SMUs of two 2600B instruments to test a 3-terminal device,
such as an N-channel JFET. A typical application is for the 2600B to source a range of gate voltages,
while another 2600B sources voltage to the drain of the device and measures current at each
gate voltage.

Guidelines for combining SMU outputs
When combining the outputs of two 2600B SMUs, restrict operation to pulse only or limited duty cycle
operations whenever possible. DC operation in Region 1 is possible if necessary.
Do not place two voltage sources in parallel.
Do not place two current sources in series.
Carefully consider the appropriate output-off mode (smua.source.offmode) and output-off function
(smua.source.offfunc) whenever changes are made to the source function. An alternative is to
always use the high impedance output-off mode
(smua.source.offmode = smua.OUTPUT_HIGH_Z).
To obtain the cleanest pulse edges and sweep steps, the rise and fall times of the individual SMUs
must be similar. For comparable rise and fall times, the source range, source level, and limit range of
SMU 1 should match the source range, source level, and limit range of SMU 2. Because you cannot
set the source limit range directly, you must choose limit values that cause both SMUs to operate on
the same limit range.
Additional configuration guidelines are presented in the following topics. Additional information,
including examples of combining SMU instruments, is available in application notes on
tek.com/keithley.

Source current using two 2600B instruments in parallel

This configuration allows the combined SMUs to supply more current than a single SMU current
source can provide. In this example, SMU 1 and SMU 2 each supply one-half of the total current for
the SMU combination.
In this configuration, it is best practice to use only one SMU to limit the voltage output of the SMU
combination. In this example, SMU 2 limits the voltage. A good approach for making sure that both
SMUs are set to the same source limit range, which is recommended, is to set SMU 1 to the
maximum voltage allowed in Region 4, then set the limit for SMU 2 ten percent lower.

A 10% source limit margin is generally recommended, but this value can be adjusted to meet the
requirements of a specific application.

This configuration supplies more voltage than a single SMU voltage source can provide. In this
example, SMU 1 and SMU 2 each supply one-half of the total voltage for the SMU combination. For
the back-to-back series connection shown, the total voltage of the combined SMUs is VSMU 2 − VSMU 1.
To obtain a net differential voltage that is twice VSMU 2, the polarity of SMU 1 is set to the opposite of
the polarity of SMU 2.
In this configuration, it is best practice to use only one SMU to limit the current output of the SMU

Configure two 2600B SMUs to get the maximum pulsed voltage level possible in Region 4:
40 V with 9 A source limit
SMU 1 configuration (sources one-half of the total pulse voltage):
Source function:

Source range:
smua.source.rangev = 20

Idle (bias) source level (source level at base of pulse):
smua.source.levelv = -1e-12

Source polarity changes incur a 100 μs settling delay. Because the number 0 is treated as a positive
value in the 2600B, negative-going pulses with a 0 V bias level require the source to change polarity.
To ensure the proper pulse timing of SMU 1 and SMU 2, it is best to eliminate the SMU 1 polarity
changes and avoid the associated 100 μs time penalty. The easiest way to do this is set the bias
level to a negative value that is significantly less than the programming resolution of the instrument,
such as −1e−12. Functionally, this value is the same as zero, but it is mathematically negative, which
eliminates the polarity change.
Idle (bias) source limit (source limit at base of pulse):
smua.source.limiti = 1

Pulse source level (source level at top of pulse):

As explained in the note above, the polarity of SMU 1 is generally the opposite of the voltage polarity
across the device. To achieve a positive voltage across the device, program SMU 1 to a negative
voltage level. For example, to output 40 V across the device, program SMU 1 to −20 V and SMU 2 to
+20 V. To achieve a negative voltage across the device, program SMU 1 to a positive voltage level
and SMU 2 to a negative voltage level.

Source voltage with extended current using two 2600B
instruments in parallel
This example shows the recommended approach for setting the source and limit ranges and levels
when combining a SMU voltage source in parallel with a SMU current source.
Figure 18: Source voltage with extended current using parallel SMUs

The values are based on the current and voltage levels available in Region 4 of a 2601B, 2602B, or
2604B SMU, as shown in the table in Combining SMU outputs (on page 2-27). For information about
generating pulses with a 2600B, refer to Using timers to perform pulse mode sweeps (on page 4-16).
The purpose of this configuration is to supply more current than a single SMU voltage source can
provide. In this example, SMU 2 controls the voltage applied to a device-under-test (DUT). At full
power, SMU 1 supplies 47% of the current required by the load and SMU 2 supplies 53%. SMU2
sinks excess current from SMU 1 when DUT current draw is less than the maximum current of the
SMU combination.
Proper operation of this configuration requires that SMU 1 does not limit the voltage from SMU 2 and
that SMU 2 does not limit the current from SMU 1. To accomplish this:

•

Set the voltage source level of SMU 2 ten percent lower than voltage source limit of SMU 1.

•

Set the current source level of SMU 1 ten percent lower than the current source limit of SMU 2.

•

Set the voltage source limit of SMU 1 to the maximum voltage allowed in Region 4.

•

Set the current source limit of SMU 2 to the maximum current allowed in Region 4.

These settings ensure that both SMUs are set to the same source and limit ranges, as recommended.

A 10% source limit margin is generally recommended, but this value can be adjusted to meet the
requirements of a specific application.

Combining channels in series to output higher voltage
Channels in series can cause hazardous voltage (>30 VRMS, 42 VPEAK) to be present and
accessible at the 2600B output connector. A safety shield must be used whenever hazardous
voltages will be present in the test circuit. To prevent electrical shock that could cause injury
or death, never use the 2600B in a test circuit that may contain hazardous voltages without a
properly installed and configured safety shield.
When combining two 2600B SMU voltage sources in series, it is possible for the SMU combination to
output hazardous voltage levels even though the individual SMUs cannot.
The following figure illustrates a Model 2602B configured with the two channels connected in series to
output up to 80 V (40 V per channel).
Whenever hazardous voltage (>30 VRMS, 42 VPEAK) is output, a safety shield must completely
surround the DUT test circuit. When using a metal safety shield, it must be connected to a known
protective earth (safety ground) and chassis ground.

Normal output-off mode
The normal output-off mode is the default output-off mode setting. When the source-measure unit
(SMU) is in the normal output-off mode, you can select either the current or the voltage output-off
function (see Output-off function (on page 2-42)). You can also specify current and voltage output-off
limits (Output-off limits (compliance) (on page 2-43)).
When the output is turned off, the output goes to either 0 V or 0 A, depending on the selected
output-off function. Voltage is the default output-off function.

High-impedance output-off mode
For the high-impedance output-off mode (HI-Z), the output relay opens when the output is turned off.
This disconnects external circuitry from the input/output of the source-measure unit (SMU). To
prevent excessive wear on the output relay, do not use this output-off mode for tests that turn the
output off and on frequently.

Zero output-off mode
When the zero output-off mode is selected, the programmed source remains on the display, but
internally, the voltage source is selected and is set to 0 V. Measurements are made and displayed.
When the selected source is voltage, the current compliance setting remains the same as the
output-on value and compliance detection remains active.
When the selected source is current, the current compliance setting is the programmed current
source value or 10 percent full-scale of the present current range, whichever is greater.
You can use the 2600B as a current meter when it is in zero output-off mode because it outputs 0 V
but measures current.
To configure the output-off mode from the front panel:
1. Press the CONFIG key.
2. Press the OUTPUT ON/OFF control.
3. Select OFF-STATE.
4. Select MODE.
5. Select the output-off mode: HI-Z (high-impedance), NORMAL, or ZERO.

This setting is used only when the output is turned off and the 2600B is set to the normal output-off

You can set the output-off function to CURRENT or VOLTAGE through the CONFIG menu on the
front panel, or by using the smuX.source.offfunc attribute from a remote interface. VOLTAGE is
the default output-off function.
When the output is turned off and the selected output-off function is VOLTAGE
(smuX.source.offfunc = smuX.OUTPUT_DCVOLTS):

•

The source-measure unit (SMU) sources 0 V.

•

The current limit is set by the smuX.source.offlimiti attribute (default 1 mA).

When the output is turned off and the selected output-off function is CURRENT
(smuX.source.offfunc = smuX.OUTPUT_DCAMPS):

•

The SMU sources 0 A.

•

The voltage limit is set by the smuX.source.offlimitv attribute (default 40 V).

When the output-off function is set to either voltage or current, the SMU may source or sink a very
small amount of power. In most cases, this source or sink power level is insignificant.

Output-off limits (compliance)
You can set output-off limits (compliance) for the current and voltage output-off functions using the
CONFIG menu on the 2600B front panel, or by setting the smuX.source.offlimitY attribute from
a remote interface. The output-off limits only apply when the output-off mode is normal.

Setting output-off limits
Setting the output-off limit for CURRENT (smuX.source.offlimiti) specifies the current limit for
the voltage source; setting the output-off limit for VOLTAGE (smuX.source.offlimitv) specifies
the voltage limit for the current source.
To configure the output-off limits from the front panel:
1. Press the CONFIG key.
2. Press the OUTPUT ON/OFF control.
3. Select OFF-STATE and then select LIMIT.
4. Select CURRENT or VOLTAGE.
5. Set the limit value and then press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
6. Press the EXIT key to return to the normal display.
To set the current limit in NORMAL output-off mode remotely:*
smuX.source.offlimiti = iValue

To set the voltage limit in NORMAL output-off mode remotely:*

Range
The selected measurement range affects the accuracy of the measurements and the maximum signal
that can be measured. If the range is changed, the front-panel display may contain dashes instead of
a reading (for example, --.---- mA). This indicates that no measurement was made using the range
that is presently selected. To update the displayed reading, trigger a measurement (if in local control,
press the TRIG key).

Maximum source values and readings
The full-scale output for each voltage and current source range is 101 percent of the selected range,
but the full-scale measurement is 102 percent of the range. For example, ±1.01 A is the full-scale
source value for the 1 A range, and ±102 mA is the full-scale reading for the 100 mA measurement
range. Input levels that exceed the maximum levels cause the overflow message to be displayed. The
instrument autoranges at 100 percent of the range.

Section 2: Sourcing and measuring

Measure autodelay
The measure delay is a specific delay that is applied before each measurement is made. This delay is
disabled by default (measurements are made immediately). You can change the default delay by
setting the smuX.measure.delay (on page 9-221) attribute either to a specific value or to an autodelay
setting (set smuX.measure.delay = smuX.DELAY_AUTO). If the measure delay is set to the
autodelay setting, a range-dependent delay is applied each time the instrument performs a current
measurement. This delay also happens for the measurement that is made after changing current
ranges during an autoranged measurement. The default measurement delay varies by model.
You can increase or decrease the autodelay by changing the delay factor (for example, to reduce the
delay across all ranges by half, set smuX.measure.delayfactor = 0.5). For additional information,
refer to smuX.measure.delayfactor (on page 9-222).

Ranging limitations
If the source and measure functions are different (such as source V and measure I, or source I and
measure V), you can set source and measure ranges separately. If both the source and the measure
functions are the same, the measure range is locked to the source range. In addition, there are
other limitations.

•

2601B, 2602B, 2604B: With the 40 V V-Source range selected, the highest current measurement
range is 1 A. With the 3 A I-Source range selected, the highest voltage measurement range is 6 V.
Refer to Operating boundaries (on page 5-4) for power derating information.

•

2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2635B, 2636B: With the 200 V V-Source range selected, the
highest current measurement range is 100 mA. With I-Source ranges above 100 mA selected, the
highest voltage measurement range is 20 V. Refer to Operating boundaries (on page 5-4) for
power derating information.

Manual ranging
Use the range keys,

and

, to select a fixed range:

•

To set the source range, press the SRC key, and then use the RANGE keys to set the range.

•

To set the measure range, select the single-channel display mode (2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B,
2634B, or 2636B), and then use the RANGE keys to set the range.

If the instrument displays the overflow message on a particular range, select a higher range until an
on-range reading is displayed. To ensure the best accuracy and resolution, use the lowest range
possible that does not cause an overflow.

Autoranging
To use automatic source ranging, press SRC then the AUTO range key.
To use automatic measure ranging, press the MEAS key followed by the AUTO range key. The
AUTO indicator turns on when source or measure autoranging is selected.
When autorange is selected, the instrument automatically sets the best range to source or measure
the applied signal. The instrument increases the range to 100 percent of the present range.

When you change a source value, source autoranging is automatically turned off and remains off
until you re-enable it.

Low range limits
The low range limit sets the lowest range that the 2600B uses when autoranging is enabled. This
feature is useful for minimizing autorange settling times when measurements require numerous
range changes.
To individually set low range limits for Source V, Source I, Measure V, and Measure I:
1. Press the CONFIG key, then press either the SRC key (for source) or the MEAS key
(for measure).
2. Select voltage or current source, or measure, as appropriate, and then press the ENTER key or
the navigation wheel.
3. Select LOWRANGE, and then press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
4. Set the low range to the appropriate setting, and then press the ENTER key or

Digits
The display resolution of the measured reading depends on the DIGITS setting. The default display
resolution setting is 6.5 digits. The DIGITS setting selects display resolution for all
measurement functions.
The DIGITS setting has no effect on the format of readings returned by a print() command over a
remote interface. To adjust the format of remote interface readings, see format.asciiprecision (on
page 9-100).
The number of displayed digits does not affect accuracy or speed. Accuracy and speed are controlled
by the SPEED setting (see Speed (on page 2-50)).

Setting display resolution from the front panel
To set the display resolution, press the DIGITS key until the correct number of digits is displayed.
Available display resolutions are 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 digits.

For 2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, and 2636B when they are in dual-channel display mode,
the maximum display resolution is 4.5 digits. Pressing the DIGITS key displays a message that
advises you to change the display to the indicated channel. This message is also displayed in

Speed
The SPEED key sets the integration time, or measurement aperture, of the analog to digital (A/D)
converter (period the input signal is measured). The integration time affects the usable digits, the
amount of reading noise, and the reading rate of the instrument. The integration time is specified in
parameters based on the number of power line cycles (NPLC), where 1 PLC for 60 Hz is 16.67 ms
(1/60) and 1 PLC for 50 Hz is 20 ms (1/50).
In general, the fastest integration time (0.001 PLC) results in the fastest reading rate, but also causes
increased reading noise and fewer usable digits. The slowest integration time (25 PLC) provides the
best common-mode and normal-mode noise rejection but has the slowest reading rate. Settings
between the fastest and slowest integration times are a compromise between speed and noise. The
default power-on speed setting is NORMAL (1 PLC).

The SPEED setting affects all measurement functions. After setting speed, display resolution can be
changed using the DIGITS key. For the 2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, or 2636B in
single-channel display mode, if you press the SPEED key for the channel that is not being displayed,
it results in a display message to change to the other channel before setting the speed.

Setting the speed from the front panel
Press the SPEED key (or use the CONFIG menu) to display the following menu items:

•

FAST: Sets the measurement speed to 0.01 PLC (fast performance, but accuracy is reduced)

•
•

MED: Sets the measurement speed to 0.10 PLC (speed and accuracy are balanced)

•

HI-ACCURACY: Sets the measurement speed to 10.00 PLC (high accuracy, but speed is
reduced)

•

OTHER: Sets the measurement speed to any PLC value from 0.001 to 25

NORMAL: Sets the measurement speed to 1.00 PLC (speed and accuracy are balanced)

Setting the speed using the remote interface

Sweep operation
The 2600B can generate dc and pulsed sweeps to perform source-only sweeps, source-and-measure
sweeps, or measure-only sweeps. The following information describes the sweep types of dc and
pulsed linear staircase, dc and pulsed logarithmic staircase, and dc and pulsed list.
DC and pulsed linear staircase sweeps: With this type of sweep, the voltage or current increases
or decreases in fixed steps, beginning with a start voltage or current and ending with a stop voltage or
current. The figure below shows an increasing linear staircase sweep and a pulsed staircase sweep.
Pulsed linear staircase sweeps function the same way that dc linear staircase sweeps function,
except that pulsed linear staircase sweeps return to the idle level between pulses.
Figure 20: DC and pulsed linear staircase sweeps

DC and pulsed logarithmic staircase sweeps: In this type of sweep, the current or voltage
increases or decreases geometrically, beginning with a start voltage or current and ending with a stop
voltage or current. The figure below shows an increasing logarithmic staircase sweep and a pulsed
logarithmic staircase sweep. Pulsed logarithmic staircase sweeps function the same way that dc
logarithmic staircase sweeps function, except that pulsed logarithmic staircase sweeps return to the
idle level between pulses.
Figure 21: DC and pulsed logarithmic staircase sweeps

DC and pulsed list sweeps: The list sweep allows you to program arbitrary sweep steps anywhere
within the output voltage or current range of the 2600B. The following figure shows a list sweep with
arbitrary steps and a pulsed list sweep. Pulsed list sweeps function the same way that dc list sweeps
function, except that pulsed list sweeps return to the idle level between pulses.

Section 2: Sourcing and measuring

A linear staircase sweep is configured using a start level, a stop level, and the total number of points,
including the start and stop points. The step size is determined by the start and stop levels, and the
number of sweep points:
step = (stop - start) / (points - 1)

The number of sweep steps actually performed is determined by the trigger count. Refer to
Triggering (on page 4-1) for more information.

The sweep can be either positive-going or negative-going, depending on the relative values of the
start and stop parameters. When the sweep starts, the output goes to the start source level. The
output then changes in equal steps until the stop level is reached. If the trigger count is greater than
the number of points specified, the SMU starts over at the beginning value.
To configure a linear staircase sweep, use the smuX.trigger.source.linearY() command.
This function configures the source values the SMU outputs when performing a linear sweep. After
configuring the sweep, you must also enable the source action by setting the following attribute:*
smuX.trigger.source.action

* smuX can be smua for channel A or smub for channel B
Example:
-- Configure a sweep from 0 to 10 V in 1 V steps.
smua.trigger.source.linearv(0, 10, 11)
-- Enable the source action.
smua.trigger.source.action = smua.ENABLE

For more information, see smuX.trigger.source.linearY() (on page 9-272).

Logarithmic staircase sweeps
This type of sweep is similar to the linear staircase sweep. The steps, however, are done on a
logarithmic scale.
Like a linear staircase sweep, logarithmic sweeps are configured using a start level, a stop level, and
the number of points. The step size is determined by the start and stop levels, and the number of
sweep points. However, in a logarithmic sweep, the step size increases or decreases exponentially.
To create an increasing logarithmic sweep, set the stop value to be greater than the start value. To
create a decreasing logarithmic sweep, set the stop value to be less than the start value. When
enabled, a measurement is made at each step after source and measurement settling time. An
asymptote can also be used to control the inflection of a sweep.

When this sweep starts, the output goes to the start level (1 V) and sweeps through the symmetrical
log points.
To configure a logarithmic staircase sweep, use the smuX.trigger.source.logY()function. This
function configures the source values the source-measure unit (SMU) outputs when performing a
logarithmic sweep. After configuring the sweep, you must also enable the source action by setting the
smuX.trigger.source.action attribute.
Example:
-- Configure a sweep from 1 to 10 V in 10 steps with an asymptote of 0 V.
smua.trigger.source.logv(1, 10, 11, 0)
-- Enable the source action.
smua.trigger.source.action = smua.ENABLE

For more information, see smuX.trigger.source.logY() (on page 9-274).

List sweeps
Use a list sweep to configure a sweep with arbitrary steps. When enabled, a measurement is made at
each point after source and measurement settling time.
To configure a list sweep, use the smuX.trigger.source.listY()function. This function
configures the source values that the source-measure unit (SMU) outputs when performing a list
sweep. After configuring the sweep, you must also enable the source action by setting the
smuX.trigger.source.action attribute.
Example:
-- Sweep through 3 V, 1 V, 4 V, 5 V, and 2 V.
smua.trigger.source.listv({3, 1, 4, 5, 2})
-- Enable the source action.
smua.trigger.source.action = smua.ENABLE

When the sweep is started, the output level goes to the first point in the sweep. The sweep continues
through the steps in the order that they were programmed.
The following figure shows a different example of a list sweep with six measurement points. When the
sweep starts, the current or voltage goes to the first point in the sweep. The instrument cycles through
the sweep points in the programmed order.

Pulse mode sweeps
To create a pulse sweep for any of the sweep types, configure the end pulse action.
To configure a pulse sweep for source-measure unit (SMU) A, send:
smua.trigger.endpulse.action = smua.SOURCE_IDLE

To configure a dc sweep for SMU A, send:
smua.trigger.endpulse.action = smua.SOURCE_HOLD

Timers must be used to configure the pulse width and period. Refer to Using timers to perform pulsed
sweeps (on page 4-16) for details.
The pulse width is managed by controlling the duration between the source stimulus event and the
end pulse stimulus event. A latency exists between these stimulus events and their resulting source
level transitions. This trigger latency can vary based on factors such as the source range and the
electrical characteristics of the device under test (DUT).
The figure below shows the source and end pulse stimulus events in relationship to the pulse (see
Triggering (on page 4-1) for information on stimulus events). Any change in Δt results in a
corresponding change in the pulse width.

Pulse duty cycle
Duty cycle is the percentage of time during the pulse period that the output is on. It is calculated
as follows:
Duty cycle = Pulse width / (Pulse width + Off time)
For example, if the pulse width is 10 ms and the off time is 90 ms, the duty cycle is calculated
as follows:
Duty cycle

= 10 ms / (10 ms + 90 ms)
= 10 ms / 100 ms
= 0.10
= 10 percent

See Maximum duty cycle equation (on page 5-3) for additional information on calculating the
maximum duty cycle for a SMU.

Pulsing in the extended operating area
Pulse sweeps can be performed outside of the standard operating area by setting the appropriate
compliance level. Review the specifications for the 2600B to determine the maximum current and
voltage values available in pulse mode. When pulsing in the extended operating area, the
source-measure unit (SMU) forces the pulse to end early if the pulse width exceeds the maximum
value. It also delays the next source action as necessary to stay within the duty cycle capabilities of
the SMU. The following figure and table illustrate the pulse regions for a SMU when pulsing in the
extended operating area. Refer to the 2600B specifications on tek.com/keithley for the latest pulse
width and duty cycle information.

Configuring compliance limits remotely
You can configure voltage and current limits using the smuX.trigger.source.limitY attribute,
which sets the sweep source limits. For example, to set the SMU A sweep limit to 10 V, send the
command:
smua.trigger.source.limitv = 10

Configuring end sweep actions remotely
Use the end sweep action to configure the source action at the end of the sweep. The
source-measure unit (SMU) can be programmed to return to the idle source level or hold the last
value of the sweep. Configure the end sweep action by setting the
smuX.trigger.endsweep.action attribute. For example, execute the following command to
configure SMU A to return the source to the idle source level at the end of a sweep:
smua.trigger.endsweep.action = smua.SOURCE_IDLE

Configuring measurements during a sweep
You can make measurements during a sweep using the smuX.trigger.measure.Y() function.
When sweeps are run, measurements are stored in the specified reading buffer for later recall. You
can specify which reading buffer stores the readings. For example, to store the voltage readings
made during the sweep, send the commands:
smua.trigger.measure.v(vbuffername)
smua.trigger.measure.action = smua.ENABLE

To recall sweep data using the front panel:
1. Press the RECALL key.
2. Select DATA or STATISTICS.
3. If you selected DATA: Select the buffer, and then use the navigation wheel or cursor keys to
choose reading numbers to display.
4. If you selected STATISTICS: Select the buffer, and then use the navigation wheel or cursor
keys to choose MEAN, STD DEV, SAMPLE SIZE, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, or PK-PK.

Recalling readings from the reading buffer using the front panel can be done only if one of the
dedicated reading buffers is used to store the sweep data.
To recall sweep data using remote commands:
Use the printbuffer() function to request buffer readings.
See Reading buffers (on page 3-1) for details about recalling data from the buffer.

Source and measurement delays
Whenever the source-measure unit (SMU) outputs a source value in a sweep, it also applies the
programmed source delay. The default source delay is zero (0) seconds. Set an additional source
delay using the smuX.source.delay attribute.
Whenever the SMU makes a measurement in a sweep, it also applies any configured measurement
delays. Use the smuX.measure.delay attribute to program a specific measurement delay. The
default measurement delay varies by measure range.

Initiating and running sweeps
To run a sweep, you must configure the number of sweep points to output and the number of sweeps
to perform. See Triggering (on page 4-1) for more information.
Examples:
To start a sweep, use the smuX.trigger.initiate() function. Sweeps are overlapped
operations, so you can use the waitcomplete() function to suspend further operation until the
sweep is complete.
To sweep 15 source points:
smua.trigger.count = 15

To perform eight sweeps:
smua.trigger.arm.count = 8

Aborting a sweep
You can use the smuX.abort() function to terminate all overlapped operations on a
source-measure unit (SMU), including sweeps. It returns the SMU to the idle state of the remote
trigger model. See Triggering (on page 4-1) for more information.

Section 2: Sourcing and measuring

Relative offset
When making measurements, you may want to subtract an offset value from a measurement.
The relative offset feature subtracts a set value or a baseline reading from measurement readings.
When you enable relative offset, all measurements are recorded as the difference between the actual
measured value and the relative offset value. The formula to calculate the offset value is:
Displayed value = Actual measured value − Relative offset value

When a relative offset value is established for a measure function, the value is the same for all ranges
for that measure function. For example, if 0.5 A is set as a relative offset value on the 1 A range, the
relative offset value is also 0.5 A on the lower current ranges. Also, on the 1 A range, the 2600B still
overflows for a more than 1.02 A input.
When relative offset is enabled, the REL indicator turns on. Changing measurement functions
changes the relative offset value to the established relative offset value and state for that
measurement function.

Enabling and disabling relative offset from the front panel
To enable and use the relative offset feature, press the REL key on the front panel. The reading
(which becomes the relative offset value) is subtracted from itself, causing the SMU to display a zero
value. The reading is stored for use with subsequent measurements. Press the REL key a second
time to disable the relative offset.

Defining a relative offset value from the front panel
You can establish a relative offset value for the selected measurement function.
To establish a relative offset value from the front panel:
1. Press the CONFIG key and then the REL key.
2. Select the measurement function (CURRENT, VOLTAGE, OHMS, or WATTS).
3. Press ENTER or the navigation wheel. The present relative offset value is displayed.
4. Set the relative offset value.
5. With the relative offset value displayed, press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel, and then
press the EXIT (LOCAL) key to back out of the menu structure.

Filters
The filter feature lets you set the filter response to stabilize noisy measurements. The 2600B uses a
digital filter, which is based on reading conversions. The displayed, stored, or transmitted reading is
calculated using one or more reading conversions (from 1 to 100).

Filter types
The 2600B provides two averaging filters and a median filter. The power-on default is the
repeating filter.
The averaging filters are repeating and moving, as shown in the following figure. For the repeating
filter, the stack (filter count) is filled, and the conversions are averaged to yield a reading. The stack is
then cleared, and the process starts over.

Section 2: Sourcing and measuring

Figure 30: Repeating and moving average filters

The moving filter uses a first-in, first-out stack. When the stack (filter count) becomes full, the
measurement conversions are averaged, yielding a reading. For each subsequent conversion placed
into the stack, the oldest conversion is discarded. The stack is averaged again, yielding a new
reading.
The median filter is used to pass the reading that is nearest to the middle from a group of readings
that are arranged according to size. The median filter uses a first-in, first-out stack similar to the
moving filter. For each subsequent conversion placed into the stack, the oldest conversion is
discarded. The median is then redetermined.

2-67

Section 2: Sourcing and measuring

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Figure 31: Median filter

When a moving filter or a median filter is first enabled, the stack is empty. The first reading conversion
is placed in the stack and is then copied to the other stack locations to fill it. Thus, the first filtered
reading is the same as the first reading conversion. The normal moving filter process continues. A
true average or median reading is only yielded when the stack is filled with new reading conversions
(no copies in the stack). For example, in the figure for the moving filter, it makes ten filtered readings
to fill the stack with new reading conversions. The first nine filtered readings are calculated using
copied reading conversions.

Response time
The filter parameters have speed and accuracy trade-offs for the time needed to display, store, or
output a filtered reading. These affect the number of reading conversions for speed versus accuracy
and response to input signal changes.
The filter type and count affect the overall reading speed. The moving average filter is much faster
than the repeat average filter because the instrument does not have to refill the filter stack for each
reading. Also, the number of readings averaged affects reading speed; as the number of readings
averaged increases, the reading speed decreases.

Enabling the filter from the front panel
The filter is enabled by pressing the FILTER key on the front panel. The FILT indicator is on while the
filter is enabled. Pressing FILTER a second time disables the filter.

High-capacitance mode
The Keithley Instruments 2600B has a high-capacitance mode.
Because the source-measure unit (SMU) can measure low current, issues can arise when driving a
capacitive load. The pole formed by the load capacitance and the current range resistor can cause a
phase shift in the SMU voltage control loop. This shift can lead to overshoot, ringing, and instability.
Due to the large dynamic range of current measurement and wide range of internal resistors, the
operating conditions for a given capacitive load can vary.
Based on the type, some test applications may require capacitors larger than 10 nF. While running
test scripts, it may not be possible to disconnect the capacitor from the integrated circuit and extract
accurate data. For this purpose, you can use the high-capacitance mode to minimize overshoot,
ringing, and instability.
This section provides the details that you need to estimate performance based on load capacitance
and measurement conditions.

Section 2: Sourcing and measuring

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Understanding high-capacitance mode
The source-measure unit (SMU) in the 2600B drives 10 nF of capacitance in normal operation.
Typically, an internal capacitor across the current measuring element provides phase lead to
compensate for the phase lag caused by the load capacitance on the output. This internal
capacitance across the range resistance limits the speed for a specific measurement range.
The SMU in the 2600B implements frequency compensation to achieve the highest throughput
possible for a 10 nF or less load. In addition, you must consider the settling time, voltage range,
measure delay, the quality of the capacitor, the current measure range resistor, and the load resistor.
In normal operation, the SMU in the 2600B can drive capacitive loads as large as 10 nF. In
high-capacitance mode, the SMU can drive a maximum of 50 μF of capacitance.

When high-capacitance mode is enabled, a minimum load capacitance of 100 nF is recommended.
In absence of this minimum load capacitance, overshoot and ringing may occur.
Highest throughput is achieved by using normal operation. In high-capacitance mode, the speed of
the 2600B SMU is reduced to compensate for the larger load capacitance. Stability is achieved by
inserting an internal capacitance across the current measuring element of the SMU. This internal
capacitor limits the speed for the source and measurement ranges. Therefore, when optimizing the
speed of your test configuration in high-capacitance mode, you must consider the settling time,
voltage, and current ranges, measure delay, quality of the load capacitor, and load resistance.

Understanding source settling times
Each 2600B source-measure unit (SMU) can drive up to 50 μF of a capacitance in high-capacitance
mode. To accomplish this, the speed of the 2600B SMU is reduced. Source settling times increase
when high-capacitance mode is enabled. The following tables compare the source settling times in
normal and high-capacitance modes.

In high-capacitance mode, the frequency compensation capacitance across the measure range
resistors increases. This increase leads to longer settling times on some current measure ranges.
The same range elements that are used to measure current are used to source current. Therefore,
the current limit response times respond in a similar manner.

When high-capacitance mode is enabled, the amount of time to change the current measure range
increases for each SMU. The current measure range and the current limit range are locked together.
Setting the current limit automatically updates the measure range.

Adjusting the voltage source
When driving large capacitive loads with high-capacitance mode enabled, the response time may be
lengthened by the current limit. For example, see the table titled "Current measure and source settling
times" in Understanding source settling times (on page 2-70). If a 1 μF capacitor charges to 10 V in
10 μs with a 1 A limit and the limit is set to 100 nA, the charging time is 100 seconds, as shown in the
following equation.

The total response times while in high-capacitance mode are a combination of the time spent
charging the capacitor (current limit) or the response time, whichever is greater. There is a direct
relationship between the current limit and the charging time. As the current limit decreases, the
amount of time required to charge the capacitor increases.

Understanding the capacitor
Based on the capacitor dielectric absorption, the settling time may change and the values in the
"Current measure and source settling times" table in Understanding source settling times (on
page 2-70) may differ.

Tantalum or electrolytic capacitors are well known for long dielectric absorption settling times. Film
capacitors and ceramics perform better, with NPO/COG dielectric ceramics yielding the best
settling response.

Charging the capacitor and making readings
To charge and read a capacitor in high-capacitance mode:
1. Set the current limit to a value that is higher than the value that is used for the measurement (for
example, if measuring at 10 μA, the initial current limit can be set to 1 A).
2. After the capacitor charges, lower the current limit and measure range to obtain the
current measurement.

Enabling high-capacitance mode
Before enabling high-capacitance mode, note the following:

2-72

•

It is important to read High-capacitance mode (on page 2-69) to understand the impact of
high-capacitance mode.

•

Test the device under test (DUT) and the capacitor to determine the best current limit and range
of output voltages.

•

The settling times can vary based on the DUT. It is important to test the limits of the DUT before
you use high-capacitance mode.

•

Failure to test the DUT for the appropriate current limit and output voltages can result in damage
to or destruction of the DUT.

•

For optimal performance, do not continuously switch between normal mode and
high-capacitance mode.

•

Before you charge the capacitor, start with 0 (zero) voltage across the capacitor.

Script example
Use the smuX.source.highc attribute to set and control the options for high-capacitance mode.
The programming examples and figure below illustrate how to enable high-capacitance mode on
SMU A.
1. To enable high-capacitance mode, send:
-- Enables high-capacitance mode.
smua.source.highc = smua.ENABLE

2. To run the i_leakage_measure() function in the KIHighC factory script, send:
-- Charges the capacitor.
smua.source.levelv = 5
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_ON
delay(1)
imeas = i_leakage_measure(smua, 0, 1, 300e-3, 10e-6, 100e-3)
-- The parameters in the i_leakage_measure() function represent
-- the following:
-- smu = smua
-- levelv = 0 V
-- limiti = 1 A
-- sourcedelay = 300 ms
-- measurei = 10 uA range
-- measuredelay = 100 ms

Adjust the voltage level and source delays based on the value and type of capacitor along with the
magnitude of the voltage step and the current measure range.

Front-panel reading buffer control ............................................ 3-1
Remote reading buffer programming ....................................... 3-7

Overview
Reading buffers capture measurements, ranges, instrument status, and output state of the Keithley
Instruments 2600B. The 2600B has two default reading buffers for each channel. In addition to the
default buffers, you can create user-defined reading buffers. You can use the reading buffers to
acquire readings.
You can access reading buffers from the front panel or over the remote command interface.
The default reading buffers can store more than 60,000 readings if you enable the options for
timestamps and source values. To store 140,000 readings internally, you can disable the timestamps
and source values.
You can save reading buffers to internal nonvolatile memory in the instrument or to a USB flash drive.
Once you save the reading buffers to a USB flash drive, insert the USB flash drive into the USB port
on your computer to view the data in any compatible data analysis application or to transfer the data
from the USB flash drive to your computer.

Front-panel reading buffer control
The dedicated reading buffers can be configured, stored, and recalled when in local mode operation.
Use the front panel to navigate and configure the reading buffers options and to save and recall
stored readings.

Recalling readings
To recall the data stored in a reading buffer:
1. Press the RECALL key.
2. Select DATA or STATISTICS.
3. Select the buffer to display: CHANx-BUFF1 or CHANx-BUFF2 (where X is A on the 2601B,
2611B, or 2635B, or X is A or B on the 2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, or 2636B). The
data or statistics are displayed.
▪

If you are recalling data, the reading display is on the top left, and the buffer location number
is on the right. The source values are on the lower left side of the display (if enabled); the
timestamp (if used) is on the lower right side.

▪

If you are recalling statistics, the information includes values for MEAN, STD DEV, SAMPLE
SIZE, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, and PK-PK.

▪

The source display field identifies the buffer: SrcA1 (buffer 1), SrcA2 (buffer 2). For
two-channel instruments (2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2636B): SrcB1 (buffer 1),
SrcB2 (buffer 2).

Buffer location number
The buffer location number indicates the memory location of the source-measure reading. For
example, location #000001 indicates that the displayed source-measure reading is stored at the first
memory location.

Timestamp
If the timestamp is enabled, the first source-measure reading stored in the buffer (#0000001) is
timestamped at 0.000 seconds. Subsequent readings are timestamped relative to when the first
measurement was made. The interval between readings depends on the reading rate.

Displaying other buffer readings and statistics
To display other readings and statistics in the reading buffer:
1. While still in the buffer recall mode:
▪

If viewing the data stored in the buffer, turn the navigation wheel to increment and decrement
the selected digit of the location number by one. Press the navigation wheel and then turn it
or use the CURSOR keys to move to the next digit.

▪

If viewing the statistics stored in the buffer, turn the navigation wheel or use the CURSOR
keys to scroll between MEAN, STD DEV, SAMPLE SIZE, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, and PK-PK.

2. To exit from the reading buffer recall mode, press the EXIT (LOCAL) key.

Dual buffer example
The programming example below shows a script that stores current and voltage readings using
buffer 1 for current and buffer 2 for voltage readings. The 2600B stores 100 current and voltage
readings and then recalls all 100 sets of readings.
-- Restore 2600B defaults.

-- Select measure I autorange.
smua.measure.autorangei = smua.AUTORANGE_ON
-- Select measure V autorange.

-- Set buffer count to 100.
smua.measure.count = 100
-- Set measure interval to 0.1 s.
smua.measure.interval = 0.1
-- Select source voltage function.
smua.source.func = smua.OUTPUT_DCVOLTS
-- Output 1 V.
smua.source.levelv = 1
-- Turn on output.
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_ON
-- Store current readings in buffer 1, voltage readings in buffer 2.
smua.measure.overlappediv(smua.nvbuffer1, smua.nvbuffer2)
-- Wait for buffer to fill.
waitcomplete()
-- Turn off output.
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_OFF
-- Output buffer 1 readings 1 to 100.
printbuffer(1, 100, smua.nvbuffer1)
-- Output buffer 2 readings 1 to 100.
printbuffer(1, 100, smua.nvbuffer2)

Remote reading buffer programming
You can get readings by making overlapped or sequential measurements. Overlapped commands do
not finish executing before the next command starts. Sequential commands complete execution
before the next command starts executing.
The measured value is not the only component of a reading. The measurement status (for example,
“In Compliance” or “Overranged”) is also an element of data associated with a particular reading.
All routines that return measurements can store the measurements in the reading buffers. Overlapped
measurements always return readings in a reading buffer. Nonoverlapped measurement functions
can return single-point measurement values or store multiple values in a reading buffer.

Section 3: Reading buffers

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

A reading buffer is based on a Lua table. The measurements are accessed by ordinary array
accesses. If rb is a reading buffer, the first measurement is accessed as rb[1] and the ninth
measurement as rb[9]. The additional information in the table is accessed as additional members of
the table.
The load, save, and write operations for reading buffers function differently in the remote state. From
a remote command interface, you can extract data from reading buffers as the instrument acquires
the data.

Dedicated reading buffer designations
Each source-measure unit (SMU) contains dedicated reading buffers:

•

smua.nvbuffer1 (buffer 1 for channel A)

•

smua.nvbuffer2 (buffer 2 for channel A)

•

smub.nvbuffer1 (buffer 1 for channel B)

•

smub.nvbuffer2 (buffer 2 for channel B)

To access a reading buffer, include the name of the SMU in the attribute. For example, the following
command stores readings from channel A into buffer 1:
smua.measure.overlappedi(smua.nvbuffer1)

Dedicated reading buffer example
The following programming example illustrates how to store data using dedicated reading buffer 1. In
the example, the 2600B loops for voltages from 0.01 V to 1 V with 0.01 V steps (performing a
staircase sweep), stores 100 current readings and source values in buffer 1, and then recalls all 100
readings and source values.
-- Restore 2600B defaults.
smua.reset()
-- Select channel A display.
display.screen = display.SMUA
-- Display current.

Buffer storage control attributes
The following table contains buffer storage control attributes.

Before changing the collectsourcevalues, collecttimestamps, or timestampresolution
attributes, you must clear the buffer using the smuX.nvbuffer1.clear() or
smuX.nvbuffer2.clear() command.

Buffer storage attribute

Description

appendmode

The append mode is either off or on. When the append mode is off, a new
measurement to this buffer overwrites the previous contents. When the append
mode is on, the first new measurement is stored at the end of the existing data.
This attribute is off when the buffer is created.
When this attribute is on, the reading buffer cache improves access speed to
reading buffer data. When running successive operations that overwrite reading
buffer data without running any commands that automatically invalidate the
cache, the reading buffer may return stale cache data. This attribute is
initialized to on when the buffer is created.
When this attribute is on, source values are stored with readings in the buffer.
This value, off or on, can be changed only when the buffer is empty. When the
buffer is created, this attribute is initialized to off.
When this attribute is on, timestamps are stored with readings in the buffer.
This value, off or on, can be changed only when the buffer is empty. When the
buffer is created, this attribute is initialized to off.
The reading buffer fill count sets the number of readings to store before
restarting at index 1. If the value is 0, then the capacity of the buffer is used.
This attribute is only used when the fillmode attribute is set to
FILL_WINDOW.

cachemode

collectsourcevalues

collecttimestamps

fillcount

fillmode

The reading buffer fill mode controls how new data is added to the reading
buffer. When this attribute is set to FILL_ONCE, the reading buffer does not
overwrite readings. If the buffer fills up, new readings are discarded.
When this attribute is set to FILL_WINDOW, new readings are added after
existing data until the buffer holds fillcount elements. Once there are
fillcount elements, new data starts overwriting data starting at index 1.

timestampresolution

The timestamp resolution, in seconds. When the buffer is created, its initial
resolution is 0.000001 seconds. At this resolution, the reading buffer can store
unique timestamps for up to 71 minutes. This value can be increased for
long tests.

Buffer read-only attributes
The following table contains buffer read-only attributes.

store 100 readings:
mybuffer = smua.makebuffer(100)

You can delete allocated reading buffers by sending the following command:

Triggering
Triggering allows you to source signals and capture measurements when an input signal or
combination of input signals meets a set of conditions that you set. Triggering controls the timing of
when source and measure operations happen during a sweep. See Sweep operation (on page 2-51)
for details on sweeping.

Remote triggering overview
There are two programming methods for triggering:

•

Using the trigger model

•

Interactive triggering

You can obtain very precise timing and synchronization between channels of multiple instruments
using the trigger model to control the actions of the source-measure unit (SMU). To achieve such
precise timing, use a static trigger configuration. When a static trigger configuration is not possible,
you can use the interactive triggering method to control the timing and actions of the SMU.
Both programming methods use trigger objects. Trigger objects generate and monitor trigger events.
External triggers are possible using digital I/O, TSP-Link® synchronization lines, LAN, command
interface, and the manual trigger (the TRIG key).

Using the remote trigger model
The source-measure unit (SMU) in the 2600B has a remote trigger model that supports a wide range
of triggering features for source sweeps, triggered measurements, and pulse actions.
Measurements using the trigger model can be made synchronously with sourcing actions or they can
be made asynchronously. The following figures graphically illustrate both modes of the remote trigger
model.

Section 4: Triggering

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Each section of the trigger model performs a function:

Arm layer

If a sweep is not in process, the SMU is in the idle state. Use the
smuX.trigger.initiate() function to move the SMU from the idle state to the arm
layer.
Begins a sweep. Each sweep starts and ends in the arm layer.

Trigger layer

All source, measurement, and pulse actions occur in the trigger layer.

Idle state

▪
▪
▪

Source: Outputs the programmed voltage or current source value.
Measurement: Where the current, voltage, resistance, and power
measurements occur.
End pulse: The end pulse action sources the idle (or bias) level if the pulse mode
is enabled.

The remote trigger model dictates the sequence of operation for the SMU when it is configured to
perform a sweep. When the SMU comes to an event detector, it suspends operation and waits for the
event you have assigned to the stimulus input. If no event is assigned, the SMU continues
uninterrupted past the event detector and through the trigger model. When the SMU comes to an
action block, it performs the appropriate action, if enabled. The SMU loops through the arm and
trigger layers until the programmed arm and trigger counts are satisfied.

Configuring source and measure actions
You can configure the source action using any of the following functions:
smuX.trigger.source.linearY()
smuX.trigger.source.logY()
smuX.trigger.source.listY()
Where:
Y = Source function (v = voltage, i = current)
Source functions cannot be changed within a sweep.
To enable the source action, set the smuX.trigger.source.action attribute to smuX.ENABLE.
The source-measure unit (SMU) can be configured to perform any or all available measurements
during a sweep using the smuX.trigger.measure.Y() function. To enable the measure action for
a simple synchronous sweep, set the smuX.trigger.measure.action attribute to smuX.ENABLE.
To enable the measure action for an asynchronous sweep, set the
smuX.trigger.measure.action attribute to smuX.ASYNC.

In asynchronous mode, trigger your measurements before the source completes the sweep (before
the end sweep action occurs). If the source loop has completed its end sweep action, the measure
loop terminates unless the measure action block is actively measuring. If this is the case, the active
measurement is allowed to complete before returning to the arm layer.

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 4: Triggering

For more information about the sweep functions, refer to Sweep operations (on page 2-51).
Configured source and measure delays are imposed when the SMU executes the source and
measure action blocks. Additionally, if the measure count setting is greater than one, then the
measure count is satisfied each time the measure action is performed.
The arm and trigger counts must be set to control how many times the SMU executes the source and
measure actions. The arm count indicates the number of times to execute the complete sweep. The
trigger count sets the number of loops in the trigger layer. Typically, you set the trigger count to be
equal to the number of points in the configured sweep. If the trigger count is not equal to the number
of points configured in the sweep, then one of the following occurs:

•

If the trigger count is greater than the number of points in a sweep, the SMU satisfies the trigger
count by restarting the sweep values from the beginning. The points are configured by the
smuX.trigger.source.linearY(), smuX.trigger.source.logY(), or
smuX.trigger.source.listY() command.

•

If the trigger count is less than the number of source values configured, the SMU satisfies the
trigger count and ignores the remaining source values.

For example, configure a three-point linear voltage sweep from 1 V to 3 V, with the trigger count set to
2. The SMU outputs 1 V, 2 V. If the trigger count is set to 6, the SMU outputs the values 1 V, 2 V, 3 V,
1 V, 2 V, 3 V, repeating the source values twice in a single sweep.

Enabling pulse mode sweeps using the end pulse action
Enable pulse mode sweeps using the end pulse action. The example command below illustrates how
to configure pulse mode sweeps by setting the end pulse action:
smua.trigger.endpulse.action = smua.SOURCE_IDLE

You can use timers to configure the pulse width and period (see Timers (on page 4-14) for more
information). To disable pulse mode sweeps, set the smuX.trigger.endpulse.action attribute
to smuX.SOURCE_HOLD.

SMU event detectors
As shown in Using the remote trigger model (on page 4-3), the source-measure unit (SMU) has
multiple event detectors to control the timing of various actions, as shown in the table below. Each
event detector monitors for the trigger event assigned to the associated stimulus input. Operation
through the trigger model is delayed at the event detector until the programmed trigger event occurs.
If the stimulus input is set to zero (0), the SMU continues uninterrupted through the remote
trigger model.

Controls execution of the end pulse action.

For the SMU, action overruns occur when a new trigger is detected before the previous trigger is
acted upon. When the trigger model is configured for asynchronous measurements, a measurement
trigger generates an overrun if the SMU is not ready to start a new measurement.

Clearing SMU event detectors
When an event detector is cleared, the event detector discards previously detected trigger events.
This prevents the source-measure unit (SMU) from using trigger events that were detected during the
last sweep or while it is in the arm layer, and allows it to start monitoring for new trigger events.
SMU event detectors are automatically cleared when:

•

A sweep is initiated using the smuX.trigger.initiate() function*.

•

The SMU moves from the arm layer into the trigger layer and the smuX.trigger.autoclear
attribute is enabled.
* smuX can be smua for channel A or smub for channel B

Using the TRIG key to trigger a sweep
You can configure the source-measure unit (SMU) to perform a sweep in which each source step is
triggered by the front-panel TRIG key. The source action is preceded by the source event detector.
The SMU pauses operation at an event detector until a programmed event occurs. The SMU can be
programmed to wait at the source event detector (that is, not start the source action) until the TRIG
key is pressed.
To configure the front-panel TRIG key to trigger the source action, assign the trigger event created by
the TRIG key (display.trigger.EVENT_ID) to the source stimulus input
(smuX.trigger.source.stimulus).

Using trigger events to start actions on trigger objects
You can configure trigger objects to respond to events generated by other trigger objects, such as
using a digital I/O trigger to initiate a sweep. To configure a trigger object to monitor for an event,
assign the event ID of the trigger event to the stimulus input. When the specified trigger event occurs,
the trigger object performs an action. The programming example below illustrates how to generate a
digital I/O line 2 output trigger pulse for each SMU A source complete event:
-- Configure digio line 2 to generate an output trigger pulse each
-- time SMU A generates a source complete event.
digio.trigger[2].stimulus = smua.trigger.SOURCE_COMPLETE_EVENT_ID

The following figure illustrates this example.
Figure 37: Using trigger events to start actions

A stimulus input can be configured to monitor for only one trigger event ID at a time. To monitor more
than one event, use an event blender. See Event blenders (on page 4-22) for more information.

Action overruns
An action overrun occurs when a trigger object receives a trigger event and is not ready to act on it.
The action overruns of all trigger objects are reported in the operation event registers of the status
model. Refer to Status model (on page 12-1) and the sections on each trigger object for details on the
conditions that generate an action overrun.

Digital I/O port and TSP-Link synchronization lines
The 2600B has two sets of hardware lines that can be used for triggering: 14 digital I/O lines and
three TSP-Link® synchronization lines. These trigger objects are configured and controlled in the
same way.

The 2604B, 2614B, and 2634B do not have digital input/output lines or TSP-Link®
synchronization lines.
See Digital I/O (on page 4-38) for more information about connections and direct control of the digital
I/O and TSP-Link synchronization lines.

Mode
The mode indicates the type of edge the hardware lines detect as an external input trigger. Mode also
indicates the type of signal generated as an external output trigger. The following table describes the
hardware trigger modes for the hardware trigger lines. For additional detail, refer to Hardware trigger
modes (on page 4-30).

To disable triggering on the hardware trigger lines, set the mode to bypass. This allows direct control

Timers
A timer is a trigger object that performs a delay when triggered. You can use timers to create delays,
to start measurements, and step the source value at timed intervals. When a delay expires, the timer
generates a trigger event. The 2600B has eight independent timers.

Timer attributes
Each timer has attributes that you can configure. These attributes are described in the
following sections.

Count
The count sets the number of events to generate each time the timer generates a trigger event. Each
event is separated by the delay set by the trigger.timer[N].delay command.
To configure the count, use the trigger.timer[N].count command.
Set the count number to 0 (zero) to cause the timer to generate trigger events indefinitely.

Timer delays
You can configure timers to perform the same delay each time or set up a delay list that allows the
timer to sequence through an array of delay values. All delay values are specified in seconds.
A delay is the period after the timer is triggered and before the timer generates a trigger event. The
programming example below illustrates how to configure timer 3 for a 10 s delay:
trigger.timer[3].delay = 10

You can configure a custom delay list to allow the timer to use a different interval each time it
performs a delay. Each time the timer generates a trigger event, it uses the next delay value in the list.
The timer repeats the delay list after all the elements in the delay list have been used. The example
below illustrates how to configure timer 3 for delays of 2, 10, 15, and 7 seconds:
-- Configure timer 3 to complete delays of 2 s, 10 s,
-- 15 s, and 7 s.
trigger.timer[3].delaylist = {2, 10, 15, 7}

Assigning a value to the delay attribute is the same as configuring it with a one-element delay list.

Pass-through mode
When enabled, the timer generates a trigger event immediately when it is triggered. The timer
generates additional trigger events each time a delay expires. If the pass-through attribute is disabled,
the timer does not generate a trigger event until after the first delay elapses. The programming
example below illustrates how to configure timer 3 by enabling pass-through mode:
trigger.timer[3].passthrough = true

Triggering a timer
You can configure a timer to start a delay when a trigger object generates a trigger event. Timers
cannot be started with a command. A trigger event from a trigger object must be used to initiate
a delay.

Assigning the stimulus attribute
Assign an event ID to the trigger.timer[N].stimulus attribute to configure the timer to start a
delay when a specific trigger event occurs. The programming example below illustrates how to
configure a source-delay-measure (SDM) cycle.
-- Configure the timer to begin when source action completes.
trigger.timer[1].stimulus = smua.trigger.SOURCE_COMPLETE_EVENT_ID
-- SMUA delay before a measurement begins.
smua.trigger.measure.stimulus = trigger.timer[1].EVENT_ID

Timer action overruns
The timer receives an action overrun when it generates a trigger event while a timer delay is still in
progress. Use the status model to monitor for the occurrence of action overruns. For details, see

Using timers to perform pulse mode sweeps
You can use timers to control the pulse width during a pulsed sweep. To create a pulse train, a
second timer must be used to configure the pulse period. The following topics provide examples that
show a single pulse output and a pulse train output.

To create a pulse, the SMU end pulse action smuX.trigger.endpulse.action must be set to
smuX.SOURCE_IDLE.

Pulsing from a positive to a negative pulse level
The following single pulse and pulse train examples pulse from a zero bias level to a positive pulse
level (+5 V). If you change the pulse level to a negative value, such as −5 V, the pulse width is
nominally 100 µs shorter than expected. The pulse width is shortened because the SMU source must
change polarity when pulsing from zero to a negative level, and there is an internal 100 µs delay
associated with the change. This polarity change is required because the number zero (0) is treated
as a positive value. Therefore, pulsing from zero to +5 V does not require a polarity change, but
pulsing from zero to −5 V does. There are multiple ways to obtain the correct pulse width, but the
simplest is to define a negative zero and set the bias level equal to that value.
A negative zero is a value that is mathematically negative and functionally equivalent to zero. For a
SMU, a source level setting that is functionally equivalent to zero is one that is significantly less than
the programming resolution of the source range being used. Programming resolution values are listed
by range in the SMU instrument specifications. A suitable value that works for all voltage and current
source ranges in the 2600B instruments is −1e−18. Therefore, to pulse from a zero bias level to a
negative pulse level, make the following change to the examples:
-- Set the voltage

Timer 2: Pulse width timer

•

Set the delay attribute to an appropriate pulse width (see the following figure).

•

Set the stimulus input to the event ID of timer 1 (the start of each pulse is the start of the
pulse period).

•

Set the count equal to 1 so that only one pulse is issued per period.

SMU A

•

Set the source stimulus input to the event ID of timer 1 so that the source action starts when the

•

Set the end pulse action to smua.SOURCE_IDLE so that the output is returned to the idle level
after the pulse completes.

•

Set the end pulse stimulus input to the event ID of timer 2 so that the end pulse action executes
when the pulse width timer expires.

•

Event blenders
The ability to combine trigger events is called event blending. You can use an event blender to wait
for up to four input trigger events to occur before responding with an output event.
You set the event blender operation using remote commands. You cannot set them up through the
front panel.
You can program up to six event blenders for the 2600B.

Event blender modes
Event blenders perform logical AND and logical OR functions on trigger events. For example, trigger
events can be triggered when either a manual trigger or external input trigger is detected.

•

Or: Generates an event when an event is detected on any one of the four stimulus inputs

•

And: Generates an event when an event is detected on all of the assigned stimulus inputs

Set the trigger.blender[N].orenable attribute to configure the event blender mode. Setting
the attribute to true enables OR mode; setting the attribute to false enables AND mode.

Assigning input trigger events
Each event blender has four stimulus inputs. You can assign a different trigger event ID to each
stimulus input. The programming example below illustrates how to assign the source complete event

trigger.blender[1].stimulus[1] = smua.SOURCE_COMPLETE_EVENT_ID

LAN triggering overview
Triggers can be sent and received over the LAN interface. The 2600B supports LAN extensions for
instrumentation (LXI) and has eight LAN triggers that generate and respond to LXI trigger packets.

Understanding hardware value and pseudo line state
LAN triggering is similar to hardware synchronization except that LXI trigger packets are used instead
of hardware signals. A bit in the LXI trigger packet called the hardware value simulates the state of a
hardware trigger line. The 2600B stores the hardware value of the last LXI trigger packet that was
sent or received as the pseudo line state.
The stateless event flag is a bit in the LXI trigger packet that indicates if the hardware value should be
ignored. If it is set, the 2600B ignores the hardware value of the packet and generates a trigger event.
The 2600B always sets the stateless flag for outgoing LXI trigger packets. If the stateless event flag is
not set, the hardware value indicates the state of the signal.
Changes in the hardware value of consecutive LXI trigger packets are interpreted as edge transitions.
Edge transitions generate trigger events. If the hardware value does not change between successive
LXI trigger packets, the 2600B assumes an edge transition was missed and generates a trigger event.
The following table illustrates edge detection in LAN triggering.

Understanding LXI trigger event designations
LAN trigger objects generate LXI trigger events, which are LAN0 to LAN7 (zero based). In the
command table, the LXI trigger events can be accessed using lan.trigger[1] through
lan.trigger[8].
lan.trigger[1] corresponds to LXI trigger event LAN0 and lan.trigger[8] corresponds to LXI
trigger event LAN7.

Generating LXI trigger packets
You can configure the 2600B to output an LXI trigger packet to other LXI instruments.
To generate LXI trigger packets:
1. Call the lan.trigger[N].connect() function.
2. Select the event that triggers the outgoing LXI trigger packet by assigning the specific event ID to
the LAN stimulus input.
Make sure to use the same LXI domain on both the 2600B instrument and the other instrument. If the
2600B has a different LXI domain than the instrument at the other end of the trigger connection, the
LXI trigger packets are ignored by both instruments.

Command interface triggering
A command interface trigger occurs when:

•

A GPIB GET command is detected (GPIB only)

•

A VXI-11 device_trigger method is invoked (VXI-11 only)

•

A *TRG message is received

•

A USBTMC TRIGGER message is received (USB only)

Use trigger.EVENT_ID to monitor for command interface triggers. To ensure that commands and
triggers issued over the command interface are processed in the correct order, a trigger event is not
generated until:

•

The trigger command is executed

•

trigger.wait() retrieves the trigger command from the command queue before it would
normally be executed

Command interface triggering does not generate action overruns. The triggers are processed in the
order that they are received in the 2600B command queue. The 2600B only processes incoming
commands when no commands are running. Unprocessed input triggers can cause an overflow in the
command queue. It is important to make sure a script processes triggers while it is running.

The command queue can fill up with trigger entries if too many *TRG messages are received while a
test script is running, even if the script is processing triggers. You can avoid this by using the
localnode.prompts4882 attribute (see TSP command reference (on page 9-1) for more
information), and by using trigger.wait() calls that remove the *TRG messages from the
command queue. If the command queue fills with too many trigger entries, messages like abort are
not processed.

Trigger generator
The 2600B has two trigger generators that you can use to generate trigger events. Use the
trigger.generator[N].assert()function to directly trigger events from the command interface
or a script (for example, you can trigger a sweep while the instrument is under script control).
The trigger.generator[N].EVENT_ID constant is an identification number that identifies events
generated by this generator. To have another trigger object respond to trigger events generated by
this generator, set the stimulus attribute of the other object to the value of this constant.

Section 4: Triggering

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Manual triggering
The TRIG key is used for manual triggering. Each time the TRIG key is pressed, a trigger event is
generated. You can monitor for a manual trigger event using the event ID
display.trigger.EVENT_ID. See Using the TRIG key to trigger a sweep (on page 4-8) for an
example of how to use a manual trigger.
There are no action overruns for manual triggering.

Interactive triggering
The complexity of some test system configurations may not allow a static trigger setup. These
configurations require more dynamic control of triggering than the static trigger setup provides. For
such cases, a setup providing interactive trigger programming allows the generation and detection of
trigger events that can be controlled on demand under remote control. For example, you can use
interactive triggering when you need to make multiple source function changes or implement
conditional branching to other test setups based on recent measurements.

Detecting trigger events using the wait() function
Most of the 2600B trigger objects, except for SMU trigger objects, have built-in event detectors that
monitor for trigger events. The event detector only monitors events generated by that object and
cannot be configured to monitor events generated by any other trigger object. Using the wait()
function of the trigger object causes the 2600B instrument to suspend command execution until a
trigger event occurs or until the specified timeout period elapses.
For example, use trigger.blender[N].wait(Y) to suspend command execution until an event
blender generates an event, where N is the specific event blender and Y is the timeout period. After
executing the wait() function, the event detector of the trigger object is cleared.
The following programming example illustrates how to suspend command execution while waiting for
various events to occur:
-- Wait up to 10 seconds for a front-panel TRIG key press.
display.trigger.wait(10)
-- Wait up to 60 seconds for timer 1 to complete its delay.
trigger.timer[1].wait(60)
-- Wait up to 30 seconds for input trigger to digital I/O line 10.

Section 4: Triggering

Using the assert function to generate output triggers
You can use certain trigger objects to generate output triggers on demand. These trigger objects are
the digital I/O lines, TSP-Link synchronization lines, and the LAN.
The programming example below illustrates how to generate an output trigger using the assert
function of the trigger object.

Connection parameters and commands that establish a connection are not shown in this example.
-- Generate a falling-edge trigger on digital I/O line 3.
digio.trigger[3].mode = digio.TRIG_FALLING
digio.trigger[3].assert()
-- Generate a rising edge trigger on TSP-Link sync line 1.
tsplink.trigger[1].mode = tsplink.TRIG_RISINGM
tsplink.trigger[1].assert()
-- Generate a LAN trigger on LAN pseudo line 6.
lan.trigger[6].mode = lan.TRIG_EITHER
lan.trigger[6].assert()

Using the release function of the hardware lines
Use the release function to allow the hardware line to output another external trigger when the pulse
width is set to 0.
Setting the pulse width to 0 results in an indefinite length pulse when the assert function is used to
output an external trigger. When an indefinite length pulse is used, the release function must be used
to release the line before another external trigger can be output.
The release function can also be used to release latched input triggers when the hardware line mode
is set to Synchronous. In Synchronous mode, the receipt of a falling edge trigger latches the line low.
The release function releases this line high in preparation for another input trigger.
The programming example below illustrates how to output an indefinite external trigger.
-- Set digio line 1 to output an indefinite external trigger.
digio.trigger[1].mode = digio.TRIG_FALLING
digio.trigger[1].pulsewidth = 0
digio.trigger[1].assert()
-- Release digio line 1.
digio.trigger[1].release()
-- Output another external trigger.
digio.trigger[1].assert()

page 4-11).

Using the set function to bypass SMU event detectors
The set functions are useful whenever you want the source-measure unit (SMU) to continue operation
without waiting for a programmed trigger event.
There is a set function for each SMU event detector. When called, the function immediately satisfies
the event detector, allowing the SMU to continue through the trigger model.
For example, you can use a set function when you want the SMU to immediately perform an action
the first time through the trigger model, even if a programmed trigger event does not occur. You can
use a set function to start actions on the SMU if there is a missed trigger event.
The programming example below illustrates how to have the SMU immediately perform an action the
first time through the trigger model, even if a programmed trigger event does not occur.
-- Immediately sets the arm event detector of SMU A
-- to the detected state.
smua.trigger.arm.set()
-- Sets the measure event detector of SMU A.
smua.trigger.measure.set()

Event detector overruns
If a second trigger event is generated before an event detector clears, the trigger object generates a
detector overrun. You can check for detector overruns by reading the overrun attribute of the trigger
object. The attribute is set to true when an overrun occurs. You can use the clear() function to
immediately clear the event detector, discarding any history of previous trigger events. The clear()
function also clears any detector overruns.

Detector overruns are not the same as the action overruns that are reported in the status model.
The programming example below illustrates how to check for and respond to detector overruns.
testOver = digio.trigger[4].overrun
if testOver == true then
print("Digital I/O overrun occurred.")

You can use different hardware trigger modes for digital I/O and TSP-Link® synchronization. Use
hardware triggers to integrate Keithley instruments and non-Keithley instruments in a test system.
The 2600B supports 14 digital I/O lines and three TSP-Link synchronization lines that can be used for
input or output triggering. For additional information about the hardware trigger modes, see TSP
command reference (on page 9-1).

For direct control of the line state, use the bypass trigger mode.

Falling edge trigger mode
The falling edge trigger mode generates low pulses and detects all falling edges. The figure titled
"Falling edge input trigger" shows the characteristics of the falling edge input trigger; the figure titled
"Falling edge output trigger" shows the falling edge output trigger.
Input characteristics:

•

Detects all falling edges as input triggers.

Output characteristics:

•

In addition to trigger events from other trigger objects, the digio.trigger[N].assert() and
tsplink.trigger[N].assert() commands generate a low pulse for the programmed pulse
duration.

Rising edge master trigger mode
Use the rising edge master (RisingM) trigger mode (see the figure titled "RisingM output trigger") to
synchronize with non-Keithley instruments that require a high pulse. Input trigger detection is not
available in this trigger mode. You can use the RisingM trigger mode to generate rising edge pulses.

The RisingM trigger mode does not function properly if the line is driven low by an external drive.
Output characteristics:

•

Configured trigger events, as well as the digio.trigger[N].assert() and
tsplink.trigger[N].assert() commands, cause the physical line state to float high during
the trigger pulse duration.

•

An action overrun occurs if the physical line state is high when a stimulus event occurs.

Section 4: Triggering

Understanding synchronous triggering modes
Use the synchronous triggering modes to implement bidirectional triggering, to wait for one node, or
to wait for a collection of nodes to complete all triggered actions.
All non-Keithley instrumentation must have a trigger mode that functions similar to the SynchronousA
or SynchronousM trigger modes.
To use synchronous triggering, configure the triggering master to SynchronousM trigger mode or the
non-Keithley equivalent. Configure all other nodes in the test system to SynchronousA trigger mode
or a non-Keithley equivalent.

Synchronous master trigger mode (SynchronousM)
Use the synchronous master trigger mode to generate falling edge output triggers, to detect the rising
edge input triggers, and to initiate an action on one or more external nodes with the same trigger line.
In this mode, the output trigger consists of a low pulse. All non-Keithley instruments attached to the
synchronization line in a trigger mode equivalent to SynchronousA must latch the line low during the
pulse duration.
To use the SynchronousM trigger mode, configure the triggering master as SynchronousM and then
configure all other nodes in the test system as Synchronous, SynchronousA, or to the non-Keithley
Instruments equivalent.

Use the SynchronousM trigger mode to receive notification when the triggered action on all nodes
is complete.
Input characteristics:

•

All rising edges are input triggers.

•

When all external drives release the physical line, the rising edge is detected as an input trigger.

•

A rising edge is not detected until all external drives release the line and the line floats high.

Digital I/O
The 2600B has a digital input/output port that can be used to control external digital circuitry. For
example, you can use a handler that is used to perform binning operations with a digital I/O port.

Port configuration
The digital I/O port, a standard female DB-25 connector (shown below), is on the rear panel.

Section 4: Triggering

Connecting cables for Trigger Link
Use a cable equipped with a male DB-25 connector (L-com part number CSMN25MF-5) to connect
the digital I/O port to other Keithley Instruments models equipped with a Trigger Link
(TLINK) interface.

Digital I/O lines
The port provides 14 digital I/O lines. Each output is set high (+5 V) or low (0 V) and can read high or
low logic levels. Each digital I/O line is an open-drain signal.

The 2604B, 2614B, and 2634B do not have digital I/O lines.

+5 V output
The digital I/O port provides three +5 V dc output lines that you can use to drive external logic circuitry.
Maximum combined current output for all lines is 250 mA. These lines are protected by a
self-resetting fuse with a one-hour recovery time.

Output enable line
You can use the 2601B, 2602B, and 2604B output enable (OE) line of the digital I/O with a switch in
the test fixture or component handler. With proper use, power is removed from the device under test
(DUT) when the lid of the fixture is opened. See Using output enable (on page 4-42) for more details.

The digital I/O port of the Model 2601B/2602B/2604B is not suitable for control of safety
circuits and should not be used to control a safety interlock. When an interlock is required for
safety, a separate circuit should be provided that meets the requirements of the application to
reliably protect the operator from exposed voltages.

Interlock line

At no time should you bypass the interlock feature of the 2600B. Safe operation requires a
separate interlock circuit that meets the requirements of the application to reliably protect the
operator from exposed voltages. Bypassing the interlock could expose the operator to
hazardous voltages that could result in personal injury or death.
The 2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2635B, or 2636B interlock (INT) line of the digital I/O can be used
with a switch in the test fixture or component handler. With proper use, power is removed from the
DUT when the lid of the fixture is opened. See Interlock operation (on page 4-43, on page 4-44) and
Interlock (on page 4-44) for more details.
Use interlock cable assembly CA-558 to connect the 2600B interlock to either a Model 8010 High
Power Device Test Fixture or to the Model 2657A-LIM-3 LO Interconnect Module (refer to the
connection information supplied with the device).

Digital I/O configuration
The following figure shows the basic configuration of the digital I/O port. Writing a 1 to a line sets that
line high (~ +5 V). Writing a 0 to a line sets that line low (~0 V). Note that an external device pulls an
I/O line low by shorting it to ground, so that a device must be able to sink at least 960 μA per I/O line.

Controlling digital I/O lines
Although the digital I/O lines are primarily intended for use with a device handler for limit testing, they
can also be used for other purposes, such as controlling external logic circuits. You can control lines
either from the front panel or over a remote interface.
To set digital I/O values from the front panel:
1. Press the MENU key, select DIGOUT, and then press the ENTER key or press the
navigation wheel.
2. Select DIG-IO-OUTPUT, and then press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
3. Set the decimal value as required to set digital I/O lines in the range of 0 to 16,383 (see the table
in Digital I/O bit weighting (on page 4-41)), and then press the ENTER key or the
navigation wheel. For example, to set digital I/O lines 3 and 8, set the value to 132.
4. Press the EXIT (LOCAL) key as needed to return to the main menu.
To write-protect specific digital I/O lines to prevent their values from being changed:
1. Press the MENU key, then select DIGOUT and then press the ENTER key or the
navigation wheel.
2. Select WRITE-PROTECT, and then press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
3. Set the decimal value as required to write-protect digital I/O lines within the range of 0 to 16,383
(see Digital I/O bit weighting (on page 4-41)), and then press the ENTER key or the navigation
wheel. For example, to write-protect digital I/O lines 4 and 10, set the value to 520.
4. Press the EXIT (LOCAL) key as needed to return to the main menu.
To remove write protection, reset the decimal value to include only the lines that you want to write
protect. To remove write protection from all lines, set the value to 0.

Section 4: Triggering

When an interlock is required for safety, a separate circuit should be provided that meets the
requirements of the application to reliably protect the operator from exposed voltages. The
digital I/O port of the 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B is not suitable for control of safety circuits and
should not be used to control a safety interlock.

Output enable operation
When output enable is enabled, the output of the 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B can only be turned on
when the output enable line is pulled high through a switch to +5 V, as shown in the following figure. If
the lid of the test fixture opens, the switch opens and the output enable line goes low, which turns off
the output of the instrument. The output does not automatically turn on when output enable is set high.
The output can be turned on again when +5 is applied to the output enable line.

Figure 58: Using the output enable line

Front-panel control of output enable
To activate the output enable line from the front panel:
1. Press the CONFIG key followed by the OUTPUT ON/OFF control.
2. Choose DIO-CONTROL, then press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
3. To activate the output enable signal, select OE_OUTPUT_OFF. This causes the source-measure
unit (SMU) output to be blocked if the output enable is not asserted (connected to +5 V).
To deactivate the output enable signal, select NONE. The state of the output enable signal has
no effect on the SMU output.
4. Press the EXIT (LOCAL) key as needed to return to the normal display.

Remote control of output enable
Use one of these commands to control output enable action:
smuX.source.outputenableaction = smuX.OE_NONE
smuX.source.outputenableaction = smuX.OE_OUTPUT_OFF

For the 2601B, smuX is smua (SMU Channel A). For the 2602B and 2604B, this value can be smua or
smub (for SMU channel A or SMU channel B, respectively).
When set to smuX.OE_NONE, the 2600B does not take action when the output enable line is low.
When set to smuX.OE_OUTPUT_OFF, the instrument turns the output off as if the
smuX.source.output = smuX.OUTPUT_OFF command was received. The instrument does not
automatically turn its output on when the output enable line returns to the high state. For example, the
following command activates the output enable for SMU A:
smua.source.outputenableaction = smua.OE_OUTPUT_OFF

Interlock
The interlock is available on the 2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2635B, and 2636B only.
The digital I/O port provides the interlock line for use with a test fixture switch. When properly used,
the output of the instrument turns off when the lid of the test fixture is opened. See “DUT test
connections” in the Series 2600B User's Manual for important safety information when using a test
fixture. Follow standard safety and electrical practices by verifying the correct operation of all
components related to system safety, including the interlock.

The interlock circuit must be positively activated in order for the high voltage output to be
enabled. The interlock helps facilitate safe operation of the equipment in a test system.
Bypassing the interlock could expose the operator to hazardous voltages that could result in
personal injury or death.

Interlock operation
When on the 200 V source range, the output of the 2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2635B, and 2636B
can only be turned on when the interlock line is driven high through a switch to +5 V (as shown). If the
lid of the test fixture opens, the switch opens, and the interlock line goes low, turning the output of the
instrument off. The output is not automatically turned on when the interlock line is set high. The output
cannot be turned back on until the interlock line is set high.
A signal of > 3.4 V at 24 mA (at an absolute maximum of 6 V) must be externally applied to pin 23 to
ensure 200 V operation. This signal is pulled down to chassis ground with a 10 kΩ resistor. 200 V
operation is blocked when the INTERLOCK signal is < 0.4 V (an absolute minimum of −0.4 V).

Using TSP-Link trigger lines for digital I/O
Each trigger line is an open-drain signal. When using the TSP-Link® trigger lines for digital I/O, any
node that sets the programmed line state to zero (0) causes all nodes to read 0 from the line state.
This occurs regardless of the programmed line state of any other node. Refer to the table in Digital
I/O bit weighting (on page 4-41) for digital bit-weight values.

Use the commands in following table to perform basic steady-state digital I/O operations; for example,
you can program the 2600B to read and write to a specific TSP-Link trigger line or to the entire port.

The TSP-Link trigger lines can be used for both input and output. You must write a 1 to all TSP-Link

Source-measure concepts
This section provides detailed information about source-measure concepts, including:

•

Limit principles (on page 5-1)

•

Overheating protection (on page 5-2)

•

Operating boundaries (on page 5-4)

•

Basic circuit configurations (on page 2-2)

•

Guard (on page 5-22)

Limit principles
A limit acts as a clamp. If the output reaches the limit value, the 2600B attempts to prevent the output
from exceeding that value. This action switches the source from a voltage source to a current source
(or from a current source to a voltage source) when a limit is reached.
As an example, assume the following:

•

2600B instrument: VSRC = 10 V; ILIMIT = 10 mA

•

Device-under-test (DUT) resistance: 10 Ω

With a source voltage of 10 V and a DUT resistance of 10 Ω, the current through the DUT should be
10 V / 10 Ω = 1 A. However, because the limit is set to 10 mA, the current does not exceed that value,
and the voltage across the resistance is limited to 100 mV. In effect, the 10 V voltage source is
transformed into a 10 mA current source.
The 2600B SMU output does not exceed the compliance limit, except for the compliance limit
conditions described in Source-measure capabilities (on page 2-2).

Section 5: Theory of operation

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Overheating protection
Proper ventilation is required to keep the System SourceMeter® instrument from overheating. Even
with proper ventilation, the instrument can overheat if the ambient temperature is too high or the
System SourceMeter® instrument is operated in sink mode for long periods. The instrument has an
overtemperature protection circuit that turns the output off if the instrument overheats. When the
overtemperature protection circuit turns the output off, a message indicating this condition is
displayed. You cannot turn the output on until the instrument cools down.

Power equations to avoid overheating
To avoid overheating, do not operate any channel on the instrument in a manner that forces the
instrument to exceed the maximum duty cycle (DCMAX), which is computed using the General power
equation (on page 5-3) below. Factors such as the ambient temperature, quadrant of operation, and
high-power pulse levels (if applicable) affect the maximum duty cycle. Exceeding the calculated
maximum duty cycle may cause the temperature protection mechanism to engage. When this
happens, an error message displays and the instrument output is disabled until the internal
temperature of the instrument is reduced to an acceptable level.
You do not have to be concerned about overheating if the following conditions are true:

•

The instrument is used as a power source and not a power sink.

•

The ambient temperature is ≤ 30 °C.

•

Extended operating area pulsing is not being performed.

However, if any one of these is false, the instrument may overheat if operated in a manner that
exceeds the calculated maximum duty cycle, DCMAX.
The maximum duty cycle equation is derived from the power equation below by solving for DCMAX.
The general power equation describes how much power an instrument channel can source and sink
before the total power cannot be fully dissipated by the cooling system of the instrument. This
equation incorporates all the factors that can influence the power dissipated by the instrument.

Operating boundaries
Depending on how the instrument is programmed and what is connected to the output (load or
source), the instrument can operate in any of the four quadrants. The four quadrants of operation are
shown in the following figure. When operating in the first (I) or third (III) quadrant, the instrument
operates as a source (voltage and current have the same polarity). As a source, the instrument
delivers power to a load.
Figure 60: Four quadrants of operation

When operating in the second (II) or fourth (IV) quadrant, the instrument is operating as a sink
(voltage and current have opposite polarity). As a sink, it is dissipating power rather than sourcing it.
An external source or an energy storage device, such as a capacitor or battery, can force operation in
the sink region.

Continuous power operating boundaries
The general operating boundaries for 2601B, 2602B, 2604B continuous power output are shown in
the following figure (for derating factors, see General power and maximum duty cycle equations (on

Operation as a sink
When the 2600B is operating in the second quadrant or fourth quadrant, the SMU operates as a load
that sinks and dissipates power internally. The ability of the SMU to dissipate power is defined by the
boundaries shown in the previous figure. When the SMU is operating in the second or fourth quadrant,
the DUT is a power source (such as a battery, solar cell, or a power supply).

Use care when connecting a source to the 2600B that is capable of exceeding the voltage or
current limit. Using the 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B to sink more than 3 A can damage the
instrument and invalidate your warranty. Using the 2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2635B, or
2636B to sink more than 1.5 A can damage the instrument and invalidate your warranty.

Load considerations (V-source)
The boundaries within which the 2600B operates depend on the load (device-under-test, or DUT) that
is connected to the output. The following figures show operation examples for resistive loads that are
2 kΩ and 800 Ω, respectively. For these examples, the SMU is programmed to source 10 V and limit
current (10 mA).
In the following figure, the SMU is sourcing 10 V to the 2 kΩ load and subsequently measures 5 mA.
The SMU is programmed to limit power (60 mW). As shown, the load line for 2 kΩ intersects the 10 V
voltage source line at 5 mA. The current compliance limit and the power compliance limit are not
reached (the SMU is not limited through its compliance settings).

The following figure shows what happens if the resistance of the load is decreased to 800 Ω. The
DUT load line for 800 Ω intersects the current compliance limit line, which places the SMU in
compliance. When in compliance, the SMU cannot source its programmed voltage (10 V). For the
800 Ω DUT, the SMU only outputs 8 V (at the 10 mA limit).
Notice that as resistance decreases, the slope of the DUT load line increases. As resistance
approaches infinity (open output), the SMU sources virtually 10 V at 0 mA. Conversely, as resistance
increases, the slope of the DUT load line decreases. At zero resistance (shorted output), the SMU
sources virtually 0 V at 10 mA.

The following figure shows what happens if a power limit of 60 mW is applied. As the SMU attempts
to output the programmed source value of 10 V, the power compliance limit line is reached, which
places the SMU in power compliance. The SMU enforces the power compliance limit by setting the
current compliance limit line to the new power-limited current compliance limit line setting, which in
this example is 6 mA. In compliance, the SMU cannot source its programmed voltage (10 V). For the
800 Ω DUT, the SMU outputs 4.8 V at the 5 mA limit. In this example, current never exceeds the
programmed compliance of 10 mA or the programmed power compliance of 60 mW under any load.

The following figure shows a voltage sweep on a resistive load of 800 Ω. For this example, the SMU
is programmed to sweep voltage to 10 V, limit current (6 mA), and limit power (50 mW). When
sweeping, the actual source output varies according to the programmed source value until the current
limit is reached. As the figure shows, the output sources the programmed value until placed in current
compliance at the 6 mA limit. The sweep then continues (programmed current source values increase
along the green sweep points line), but the output remains at the same value as when the SMU went
into voltage compliance. This continues until the programmed source value sweeps to a high enough
level that the power limit line is reached (50 mW). At this point, the current and voltage start to
decrease, lowering the current and voltage values along the DUT load line. When the last point is
swept (10 V), the actual output is 4 V at 5 mA.

V-source sink operating boundaries
The quadrant within which the 2600B operates depends on the device-under-test (DUT) that is
connected to the 2600B output. The following example illustrates this operation using the 2600B
configured as a voltage source to discharge a 12 V power source (a battery).

The current compliance limit applies to both positive and negative currents. For example, if you set
the current compliance limit to 50 mA, the current limit applies to ±50 mA.
For this example, the 2600B is programmed to source 2 V and to limit current to 50 mA. When the
SMU turns on, the battery voltage is higher than the programmed voltage source value. Because the
SMU cannot deliver the programmed voltage, the SMU is placed in current compliance and begins to
sink current. Sink operation continues until the battery voltage equals the programmed voltage source
level and the current in the circuit drops to nearly 0 A.

The following figure shows what happens if the resistance of the load is increased to 200 Ω. The DUT

As resistance increases, the slope of the DUT load line increases. As resistance increases and

by setting the voltage compliance limit to the new power-limited voltage compliance limit setting,
which in this case is 6 V. In compliance, the SMU cannot source its programmed current of 100 mA.
For the 200 Ω DUT, the SMU only outputs 30 mA at the 6 V limit. In this example, voltage never

The voltage compliance limit applies both to positive and negative voltages. For example, if you set
the voltage compliance limit to 15 V, the voltage limit applies to ±15 V.
For this example, the 2600B is programmed to source −50 mA (the constant current) and to limit
voltage to 15 V. When the SMU turns on, it begins sinking current as determined by the programmed
current source level (−50 mA), causing a decrease in battery voltage. If the battery were ideal and
could be charged negatively, its voltage would continue to decrease until it is negatively charged at
−15 V (shown by the green arrow in the following figure), at which point the SMU is in voltage
compliance.

Reversing the polarity when sourcing current and sinking power may destroy some power
sources. To prevent a negative charge, monitor the measurement of the battery voltage on
the SMU and stop the discharge before the SMU starts to operate in quadrant III (negative
voltage). You can stop the discharge by changing the programmed current source level or by
disconnecting the SMU from the device.
As the battery drains, the battery voltage is lowered as shown by the green arrow. Operation
continues in this direction until the you stop operation or the voltage reaches the voltage compliance
limit. Because the battery is a power source, operation in this example is limited by the capability of
the battery to deliver 50 mA. See the following figure.

Guard
GUARD is at the same potential as output HI. If hazardous voltages are present at output HI,
they are also present at the GUARD terminal.
The rear-panel GUARD terminals are always enabled and provide a buffered voltage that is at the
same level as the HI (or SENSE HI for remote sense) voltage. The purpose of guarding is to eliminate
the effects of leakage current (and capacitance) that can exist between HI and LO. In the absence of
a driven guard, leakage in the external test circuit could be high enough to adversely affect the
performance of the SMU.
Leakage current can occur through parasitic or nonparasitic leakage paths. An example of parasitic
resistance is the leakage path across the insulator in a coaxial or triaxial cable. An example of
nonparasitic resistance is the leakage path through a resistor that is connected in parallel to the
device-under-test (DUT).

Guard connections
Guard is typically used to drive the guard shields of cables and test fixtures. Guard is extended to a
test fixture from the cable guard shield. Inside the test fixture, the guard can be connected to a guard
plate or shield that surrounds the device-under-test (DUT).

A safety shield must be used whenever hazardous voltages (>30 VRMS, 42 VPEAK) will be
present in the test circuit. To prevent electrical shock that could cause injury or death, never
use the 2600B in a test circuit that may contain hazardous voltages without a properly
installed and configured safety shield. The figures in this topic show the metal case of a test
fixture being used as a safety shield.

See “Guarding and shielding” in the Series 2600B User's Manual for details about guarded test
connections.

Inside the test fixture, a triaxial cable can be used to extend guard to the DUT. The center conductor
of the cable is used for HI, and the inner shield is used for guard.
The figures below show how cable guard can eliminate leakage current through the insulators in a
test fixture. In this figure, leakage current (IL) flows through the insulators (RL1 and RL2) to LO,
adversely affecting the low-current (or high-resistance) measurement of the DUT.
Also in the figures below, the driven guard is connected to the cable shield and extended to the metal
guard plate for the insulators. Since the voltage on either end of RL1 is the same (0 V drop), no
current can flow through the leakage resistance path, so the instrument only measures the current
through the DUT.

Analog-to-digital converter
The 2600B SMUs have integrating analog-to-digital converter (ADCs). The integrating ADCs use a
ratiometric analog-to-digital conversion technique. Depending on the configuration of the integrating
ADCs, periodic fresh reference measurements are required to minimize drift. The measurement
aperture is used to determine the time interval between these measurement updates. For additional
information, see Autozero (on page 2-8). To optimize operation of these ADCs, the instrument caches
the reference and zero values for the ten most recent power-line cycles. For additional information,
see NPLC caching (on page 2-9).

Measurement settling time considerations
Several outside factors can influence measurement settling times. Effects such as dielectric
absorption, cable leakages, and noise can all extend the times required to make stable
measurements. Be sure to use appropriate shielding, guarding, and aperture selections when making
low-current measurements.
Each current measurement range has a combination of a range resistor and a compensating
capacitor that must settle to allow a stable measurement. By default (when power is turned on or after
a smuX.reset() command), delays are enforced to account for approximately 6 or 6 time
constants of a given range (to reach 0.1 percent of the final value, assuming 2.3 per decade). The
table below lists the current ranges and associated default delays. In addition, a 1 Hz analog filter is
used by default on the 1 nA and 100 pA ranges.

You can manipulate both the analog filter and the default delays to produce faster response times.
Turn off the analog filter to yield faster settling times. Control the default delays by using the delay
factor multiplier. The default value for delay factor multiplier is 1.0, but adjusting it to other values
result in either a faster or slower response. For example, increasing the delay factor to 1.3 accounts
for settling to 0.01 percent of the final value. The commands to manipulate the delay factor and
analog filter are shown in the following topics.

The following code provides measure delay examples for controlling settling time delay of SMU
channel A. You can use the delay factor to apply a multiplier when smuX.measure.delay is set to
smuX.DELAY_AUTO. Setting the delay factor above 1.0 increases the delay; a value below 1.0
decreases the delay. Setting this value to 0.0 disables delays when autodelay is on.
-- Turn off measure delay (default setting is smua.DELAY_AUTO).
smua.measure.delay = 0
-- Set measure delay for all ranges to Y in seconds.
smua.measure.delay = Y
-- Adjust the delay factor.
smua.measure.delayfactor = 1.0

Programming example for controlling analog filter (2634B, 2635B,
and 2636B only)
The following code is an example of a measure delay that controls the analog filter of SMU channel A:
-- Default setting (analog filter on).
smua.measure.analogfilter = 1

This filter is only active when the current measure range is 1 nA/100 pA. Setting the attribute to zero
(0) disables the filter.

Effects of load on current source settling time
The settling time of the source-measure unit (SMU) can be influenced by the impedance of the
device-under-test (DUT) in several ways. One influence is caused by an interaction between the
impedances of the SMU current source feedback element and the DUT. This interaction can cause a
reduction in the bandwidth of the SMU. This reduction results in an increase in the settling time of the
current source.

There is a maximum DUT impedance for each current source range for which the specified current
settling times are maintained. The following table lists the DUT impedances for each of these current
source ranges. For the latest specifications, go to tek.com/keithley. The settling time on a current
source range can increase significantly when measuring DUTs that have an impedance that is higher
than the maximum DUT impedance listed below.

Creating pulses with the 2600B SMU
Although the 2600B is not a pulse generator, you can create pulses by programming the SMU to
output a dc value and then return to an idle level. For information on how to create pulses, refer to
Sweep operation (on page 2-51) and Using the remote trigger model (on page 4-3).

Pulse rise and fall times
Although the 2600B can create pulses, it is not a pulse generator (pulse rise times are
not programmable).
The pulse rise time is the time it takes a pulse to go from 10% to 90% of the maximum value of the
pulse. Pulse fall time is similar but on the trailing edge of the pulse. For the 2600B, pulse rise and fall
times can vary depending on the following factors:

5-26

•

Range and pulse settling (on page 5-27)

•

Load and operating mode (on page 5-27)

•

Compliance limit settings (for details, see Limit principles (on page 5-1))

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 5: Theory of operation

Refer to the 2600B specifications for details on source settling times. For the latest specifications, go
to tek.com/keithley.
Figure 84: Pulse rise and fall times

Range and pulse settling
Each SMU range has different specifications for source settling times. This causes different rise and
fall time characteristics depending on the set range.
In addition, pulse performance is dependent on the pulse setting as a percent of full scale. For
example, a 100 mA pulse on the 1 A range (which is 10% of full scale) performs differently than a 1 A
pulse on the 1 A range (which is full scale). Refer to the 2600B specifications for details. For the latest
specifications, go to tek.com/keithley.

SMU load and operating mode
Settling times for the current source vary with the resistive load applied. In addition to the load, the
times vary depending on whether the source-measure unit (SMU) is configured as a voltage source or
a current source, and also if the voltage source range is selected.

Pulse width
The pulse width is the interval between 10% on the rising (leading) edge to 90% on the falling (trailing)
edge. Exceeding the specified pulse width limits can result in short pulses. In addition, the jitter of the
pulse width can change the pulse width (this is especially important for short pulse widths). Jitter in
respect to pulse width is the short-term instability of the trailing edge relative to the leading edge.
Review the 2600B specifications for information on source settling time. For the latest specifications,
go to tek.com/keithley.

Introduction
Troubleshooting information includes information on the Keithley Instruments 2600B errors (including
a complete list of error messages) and LAN troubleshooting suggestions.

Error levels
Error messages are listed in Error summary list (on page 6-2). Errors have one of the following
error levels:
Number

Error level

Description

0

NO_SEVERITY

The message is information only. This level is used when the error
queue is empty; the message does not represent an error.

10

INFORMATIONAL

20

RECOVERABLE

30

SERIOUS

40

FATAL

The message is information only. This level is used to indicate status
changes; the message does not represent an error.
The error was caused by improper use of the instrument or by
conditions that can be corrected. This message indicates that an
error occurred. The instrument is still operating normally.
There is a condition that prevents the instrument from functioning
properly. The message indicates that the instrument is presently
operating in an error condition. If the condition is corrected, the
instrument returns to normal operation.
There is a condition that cannot be corrected that prevents the
instrument from functioning properly. Disconnect the DUT and turn
the power off and then on again. If the error is a hardware fault that
persists after cycling the power, the instrument must be repaired.

Effects of errors on scripts
Most errors do not abort a running script. The only time a script is aborted is when a Lua runtime error
(error code −286, "TSP runtime error") is detected. Runtime errors are caused by actions such as
trying to index into a variable that is not a table.
Syntax errors (error code −285, "Program syntax") in a script or command prevent execution of the
script or command.

Retrieving errors
When errors occur, the error messages are placed in the error queue. Use errorqueue commands
to request error message information. For example, the following commands request the complete set
of information about the next message in the error queue. They return the code, message, severity,
and node for that error:
errorCode, message, severity, errorNode = errorqueue.next()
print(errorCode, message, severity, errorNode)

The following table lists the commands associated with the error queue.

LAN troubleshooting suggestions
If you are unable to connect to the web interface of the instrument, check the following items:

•

Verify that the network cable is in the LAN port on the rear panel of the instrument, not one of the
TSP-Link® ports (see the description in Rear panel).

•

Verify that the network cable is in the correct port on the computer. The LAN port of a laptop may
be disabled when the laptop is in a docking station.

•

Verify that the configuration information for the correct ethernet card was used during the setup
procedure.

•
•
•

Verify that the network card in the computer is enabled.

•

Turn the instrument power off, and then on. Wait at least 60 seconds for the network
configuration to be completed. Verify that an IP address has been assigned to the instrument:

•
•

Verify that the IP address of the instrument is compatible with the IP address on the computer.
Verify that the subnet mask address of the instrument is the same as the subnet mask address of
the computer.

Introduction to TSP operation
Instruments that are enabled for Test Script Processor (TSP®) operate like conventional instruments
by responding to a sequence of commands sent by the controller. You can send individual commands
to the TSP-enabled instrument the same way you do when using any other instrument.
Unlike conventional instruments, TSP-enabled instruments can execute automated test sequences
independently, without an external controller. You can load a series of TSP commands into the
instrument. You can store these commands as a script that can be run later by sending a single
command message to the instrument.
You do not have to choose between using conventional control or script control. You can combine
these forms of instrument control in the way that works best for your test application.

Controlling the instrument by sending individual command
messages
The simplest method of controlling an instrument through the communication interface is to send it a
message that contains remote commands. You can use a test program that resides on a computer
(the controller) to sequence the actions of the instrument.
TSP commands can be function-based or attribute-based. Function-based commands are commands
that control actions or activities. Attribute-based commands define characteristics of an instrument
feature or operation.
Constants represent fixed values.

Section 7: Introduction to TSP operation

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Functions
Function-based commands control actions or activities. A function-based command performs an
immediate action on the instrument.
Each function consists of a function name followed by a set of parentheses ( ). Only include
information in the parentheses if the function takes a parameter. If the function takes one or more
parameters, they are placed between the parentheses and separated by commas.
Example 1
beeper.beep(0.5, 2400)
delay(0.250)
beeper.beep(0.5, 2400)

Emit a double beep at 2400 Hz. The
sequence is 0.5 s on, 0.25 s off, 0.5 s on.

Example 2
You can use the results of a function-based command directly or assign the results to variables for
later access. The following code defines x and prints it.
x = math.abs(-100)
print(x)

Output:
100

Attributes
Attribute-based commands are commands that set the characteristics of an instrument feature or
operation. For example, a characteristic of TSP-enabled instruments is the model number
(localnode.model).
Attributes can be read-only, read-write, or write-only. They can be used as a parameter of a function
or assigned to another variable.
To set the characteristics, attribute-based commands define a value. For many attributes, the value is
in the form of a number or a predefined constant.
Example 1: Set an attribute using a number
beeper.enable = 0
This attribute controls the beeps that occur when front-panel controls are selected. Setting this attribute to 0
turns off the beeper.

Example 2: Set an attribute using a constant
format.data = format.REAL64
Using the constant REAL64 sets the print format to double-precision floating-point format.

To read an attribute, you can use the attribute as the parameter of a function or assign it to another
variable.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 7: Introduction to TSP operation

Example 3: Read an attribute using a function
print(format.data)
Reads the data format by passing the attribute to the print function. If the data format is set to 3, the output is:
3.00000e+00
This shows that the data format is set to double precision floating point.

Example 4: Read an attribute using a variable
fd = format.data
This reads the data format by assigning the attribute to a variable named fd.

Queries
Test Script Processor (TSP®) enabled instruments do not have inherent query commands. Like any
other scripting environment, the print() and printnumber() commands generate output in the
form of response messages. Each print() command creates one response message.
Example
x = 10
print(x)

Example of an output response message:
10
Note that your output may be different if you set your ASCII
precision setting to a different value.

Information on scripting and programming
If you need information about using scripts with your TSP-enabled instrument, see Fundamentals of
scripting for TSP (on page 8-1).
If you need information about using the Lua programming language with the instrument, see
Fundamentals of programming for TSP (on page 8-13).

About TSP commands
This section contains an overview of the TSP commands for the instrument. The commands are
organized into groups, with a brief description of each group. Each section contains links to the
detailed descriptions for each command in the TSP command reference section of this documentation
(see TSP commands (on page 9-7)).

Beeper control
The beeper commands allow you to enable or disable and sound the instrument beeper.

Bit manipulation and logic operations
The bit functions perform bitwise logic operations on two given numbers, and bit operations on one
given number. Logic and bit operations truncate the fractional part of given numbers to make
them integers.
Logic operations
The bit.bitand(), bit.bitor(), and bit.bitxor() functions in this group perform bitwise
logic operations on two numbers. The Test Script Processor (TSP®) scripting engine performs the
indicated logic operation on the binary equivalents of the two integers. This bitwise logic operation is
performed on all corresponding bits of the two numbers. The result of a logic operation is returned as
an integer.
Bit operations
The rest of the functions in this group are used for operations on the bits of a given number. You can
use these functions to:
▪

Clear a bit

▪

Toggle a bit

▪

Test a bit

▪

Set a bit or bit field

▪

Retrieve the weighted value of a bit or field value

All these functions use an index parameter to specify the bit position of the given number. The least
significant bit of a given number has an index of 1, and the most significant bit has an index of 32.

The Test Script Processor (TSP) scripting engine stores all numbers internally as IEEE Std 754
double-precision floating-point values. The logical operations work on 32-bit integers. Any fractional
bits are truncated. For numbers larger than 4294967295, only the lower 32 bits are used.

Data queue
Use the data queue commands to:

•

Share data between test scripts running in parallel

•

Access data from a remote group or a local node on a TSP-Link® network at any time

The data queue in the Test Script Processor (TSP®) scripting engine is first-in, first-out (FIFO).
You can access data from the data queue even if a remote group or a node has overlapped
operations in process.

Digital I/O
The 2604B, 2614B, and 2634B do not have digital input/output lines. The commands to control the
digital input/output lines are not available for these models.
The digital I/O port of the instrument can control external circuitry (such as a component handler for
binning operations).
The I/O port has 14 lines. Each line can be at TTL logic state 1 (high) or 0 (low). See the pinout
diagram in Digital I/O port (on page 4-38) for additional information.
There are commands to read and write to each individual bit, and commands to read and write to the
entire port.

Section 7: Introduction to TSP operation

File I/O
You can use the file I/O commands to open and close directories and files, write data, or to read a file
on an installed USB flash drive. File I/O commands are organized into two groups:

•

Commands that reside in the fs and io table, for example: io.open(), io.close(),
io.input(), and io.output(). Use these commands to manage file system directories; open
and close file descriptors; and perform basic I/O operations on a pair of default files (one input
and one output).

•

Commands that reside in the file descriptors (for example: fileVar:seek(),
fileVar:write(), and fileVar:read()) operate exclusively on the file with which they are
associated.

The root folder of the USB flash drive has the absolute path:
"/usb1/"

You can use either the slash (/) or backslash (\) as a directory separator. However, the backslash is
also used as an escape character, so if you use it as a directory separator, you generally need to
use a double backslash (\\) when you are creating scripts or sending commands to the instrument.
For basic information about navigation and directory listing of files on a flash drive, see File system
navigation (on page 7-8).
File descriptor commands for file I/O use a colon (:) to separate the command parts rather than a
period (.), like the io commands.
File descriptors cannot be passed between nodes in a TSP-Link® system, so the io.open(),
fileVar::read(), and fileVar::write commands are not accessible to the TSP-Link system.
However, the default input and output files mentioned above allow for the execution of many file I/O
operations without any reference to a file descriptor.

File system navigation
The 2600B can use commands from the Lua fs library to navigate and list files that are available on a
flash drive. These Lua commands are in the fs command group in the instrument.
The fs commands make the file system of any given node available to the entire TSP-Link® system.
For example, you can use the command node[5].fs.readdir(".") to read the contents of the
current working directory on node 5.
The root folder of the USB flash drive has the absolute path:
"/usb1/"

You can use either the slash (/) or backslash (\) as a directory separator. However, the backslash is
also used as an escape character, so if you use it as a directory separator, you generally need to
use a double backslash (\\) when you are creating scripts or sending commands to the instrument.
The instrument supports the following Lua fs commands:
fs.chdir() (on page 9-103)
fs.cwd() (on page 9-103)
fs.is_dir() (on page 9-104)

Userstrings
Use the functions in this group to store and retrieve user-defined strings in nonvolatile memory. These
strings are stored as key-value pairs. The key is a unique identifier such as a part number or
identification string.
You can use the userstring functions to store custom, instrument-specific information in the
instrument, such as department number, asset number, or manufacturing plant location.

Factory scripts
The Keithley Instruments 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument is shipped with one or more
factory scripts saved in its flash firmware memory. A factory script is made up of a number of
functions. Some of them can be called from the front-panel LOAD TEST menu. All of them can be
called using remote programming.
A factory script is similar to a user script, except a factory script is created by Keithley Instruments at
the factory and is permanently stored in nonvolatile memory. The differences between a user script
and a factory script include the following:

•

A factory script cannot be deleted from nonvolatile memory.

•

The script listing for a factory script can be retrieved and modified, but it is then treated as a user
script. A user script cannot be saved as a factory script.

•

Factory scripts are not stored in global variables. The only references to factory scripts are in the
script.factory.scripts attribute.

•

The script.factory.catalog() function returns an iterator that can be used in a for loop
to iterate over all the factory scripts.

Example
To retrieve the catalog listing for factory scripts, send:
for name in script.factory.catalog() do print(name) end

Running a factory script
Use either of the following commands to run a factory script:
script.factory.scripts.name()
script.factory.scripts.name.run()
Where: name is the name of the factory script.
Example:
Run the factory script named KISweep.
script.factory.scripts.KISweep()

Running a factory script function from the front-panel controls
1. Press the LOAD key.
2. Select FACTORY.
3. Select the function to run and press the ENTER key or navigation wheel.
4. Press the RUN key.
5. Follow the prompts on the front panel to run the script.

Retrieving and modifying a factory script listing
The script listing for a factory script can be retrieved and modified. However, it cannot be saved as a
factory script. The modified script can be saved as a user script using the same name or a new name.
An imported factory script can only be reloaded into the 2600B as a user script.
The following function retrieves a script listing. The script code is output with the shell keywords
(loadscript or loadandrunscript and endscript):
script.factory.scripts.name.list()
Where: name is the name of the factory script.
An example that retrieves the script listing for a factory script named KISweep:
script.factory.scripts.KISweep.list()

KIPulse factory script
The KIPulse factory script provides examples of how to generate pulses and to provide a simple
pulsing interface. Pulses can be generated using the functions listed below.

Please note the following information about the KIPulse factory script:

▪
▪
▪

This factory script only operates on the channels present in the instrument executing the pulse
functions. These functions do not operate correctly if you attempt to access instrument channels
over the TSP-Link® interface.
The KIPulse factory scripts are general purpose examples that may not be suitable for all use
cases. Very short pulses (less than 1 ms pulse width) may require optimization of the examples
provided by the factory script in order to achieve settled measurements.
The PulseIMeasureV() and PulseVMeasureI() functions may be accessed from the front
panel. The remaining functions may only be accessed remotely.

Use the configuration KIPulse tag parameter pulse functions (on page 7-23) to configure a pulse train
and assign the configuration to the tag parameter (use QueryPulseConfig() to inspect configured
pulse trains). Use the initiation InitiatePulseTest() function to execute the pulse trains
assigned to its tag arguments. The conditions listed in the table below must be true for these
functions to execute successfully.

Variable off time between pulses in a pulse train
The KIPulse “Configure” functions accept the toff parameter as a table or as a number. The table
allows you to define different off times to be used after each pulse. Note the following:

•

If toff is passed as a number or only a single value is used in the table, it is used for all points in
a multiple point pulse.

•

The number of times specified in the table must match the number of points called for in
the sweep.

•

The times used in tables must match for dual channel pulsing.

•

Each specified off time must adhere to the duty cycle limits for the specified pulsing region.

Fundamentals of scripting for TSP
Though it can improve your process to use scripts, you do not have to create scripts to use the
instrument. Most of the examples in the documentation can be run by sending individual command
messages. The next few sections of the documentation describe scripting and programming features
of the instrument. You only need to review this information if you are using scripting
and programming.
Scripting helps you combine commands into a block of code that the instrument can run. Scripts help
you communicate with the instrument more efficiently.
Scripts offer several advantages compared to sending individual commands from the host
controller (computer):

•

Scripts are easier to save, refine, and implement than individual commands.

•

The instrument performs more quickly and efficiently when it processes scripts than it does when
it processes individual commands.

•

You can incorporate features such as looping and branching into scripts.

•

Scripts allow the controller to perform other tasks while the instrument is running a script,
enabling some parallel operation.

•

Scripts eliminate repeated data transfer times from the controller.

In the instrument, the Test Script Processor (TSP®) scripting engine processes and runs scripts.
This section describes how to create, load, modify, and run scripts.

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

What is a script?
A script is a collection of instrument control commands and programming statements. Scripts that you
create are referred to as user scripts.
Your scripts can be interactive. Interactive scripts display messages on the front panel of the
instrument that prompt the operator to enter parameters.

Runtime and nonvolatile memory storage of scripts
Scripts are loaded into the runtime environment of the instrument. From there, they can be stored in
nonvolatile memory in the instrument.
The runtime environment is a collection of global variables, which include scripts, that the user has
defined. A global variable can be used to store a value while the instrument is turned on. When you
create a script, the instrument creates a global variable with the same name so that you can
reference the script more conveniently. After scripts are loaded into the runtime environment, you can
run and manage them from the front panel of the instrument or from a computer. Information in the
runtime environment is lost when the instrument is turned off.
Nonvolatile memory is where information is stored even when the instrument is turned off. Save
scripts to nonvolatile memory to save them even if the power is cycled. The scripts that are in
nonvolatile memory are loaded into the runtime environment when the instrument is turned on.
Scripts are placed in the runtime environment when:

•

The instrument is turned on. All scripts that are saved to nonvolatile memory are copied to the
runtime environment when the instrument is turned on.

•

Loaded over a remote command interface.

For detail on the amount of memory available in the runtime environment, see Memory considerations
for the runtime environment (on page 8-82).

If you make changes to a script in the runtime environment, the changes are lost when the
instrument is turned off. To save the changes, you must save them to nonvolatile memory. See
Working with scripts in nonvolatile memory (on page 8-10).

What can be included in scripts?
Scripts can include combinations of Test Script Processor (TSP®) commands and Lua code. TSP
commands instruct the instrument to do one thing and are described in the command reference (see
TSP commands (on page 9-7)). Lua is a scripting language that is described in Fundamentals of
programming for TSP (on page 8-13).

Manage scripts
This section describes how to create scripts by sending commands over the remote interface.

Tools for managing scripts
To manage scripts, you can send messages to the instrument, use your own development tool or
program, use Keithley Instruments Test Script Builder (TSB) software, or use TSB Embedded on the
web interface of the instrument.
TSB software is a programming tool that you can download from the Product Support and Downloads
web page (tek.com/product-support). You can use it to create, modify, debug, and store Test Script
Processor (TSP®) scripting engine scripts. For more information about using the TSB software, see
Using Test Script Builder (TSB) (on page 8-67).
TSB Embedded is a tool with a reduced set of features than the complete Keithley TSB software.
TSB Embedded has both script-building functionality and console functionality (single-line commands).
It is accessed from a web browser. Refer to Working with TSB Embedded (on page 8-70) for
additional information.

If you are using TSB or TSB Embedded to create scripts, you do not need to use the commands
loadscript or loadandrunscript and endscript.

Create and load a script
You create scripts by loading them into the runtime environment of the instrument. You can load a
script as a named script or as the anonymous script.
Once a script is loaded into the instrument, you can execute it remotely or from the front panel.

Anonymous scripts
If a script is created with the loadscript or loadandrunscript command with no name defined,
it is called the anonymous script. There can only be one anonymous script in the runtime environment.
If another anonymous script is loaded into the runtime environment, it replaces the existing
anonymous script.

Named scripts
A named script is a script with a unique name. You can have as many named scripts as needed in the
instrument (within the limits of the memory available to the runtime environment). When a named
script is loaded into the runtime environment with the loadscript or loadandrunscript
commands, a global variable with the same name is created to reference the script.
Key points regarding named scripts:

•

If you load a new script with the same name as an existing script, the existing script becomes an
unnamed script, which in effect removes the existing script if there are no variables that
reference it.

•

Sending revised scripts with different names does not remove previously loaded scripts.

•

Named scripts can be saved to internal nonvolatile memory. Saving a named script to nonvolatile
memory allows the instrument to be turned off without losing the script. See Working with scripts
in nonvolatile memory (on page 8-10).

Load a script by sending commands over the remote interface
To load a script over the remote interface, you can use the loadscript, loadandrunscript, and
endscript commands.
The loadscript and loadandrunscript commands start the collection of messages that make
up the script. When the instrument receives either of these commands, it starts collecting all
subsequent messages. Without these commands, the instrument runs them immediately as individual
commands.
The endscript command tells the instrument to compile the collection of messages. It compiles the
messages into one group of commands. This group of commands is loaded into the runtime
environment.
The following figure shows an example of how to load a script named “test.” The first command tells
the instrument to start collecting the messages for the script named “test.” The last command marks
the end of the script. When this script is run, the message This is a test is displayed on the
instrument and sent to the computer.

Figure 85: Loadscript and endscript example

To load a named script by sending commands:
1. Send the command loadscript scriptName, where scriptName is the name of the script.
The name must be a legal Lua variable name.
2. Send the commands that need to be included in the script.
3. Send the command endscript.
4. You can now run the script. See Run scripts (on page 8-7).

To run the script immediately, use loadandrunscript scriptName instead of loadscript.

Load a script from the instrument front panel
You can also load scripts from a USB flash drive to the runtime environment of the instrument.
Depending on the content of the TSP file on the drive, the script can be loaded either as an
anonymous script without a designated name, or as a named script with a user-defined name. Only
named scripts can be saved to internal nonvolatile memory. Only one anonymous script can exist in
the runtime environment.
To load a script into the instrument with a specific name, the TSP file must include the shell keywords
loadscript and endscript, along with the specified script name, as shown in the example file
MyScript1.tsp, which contains the script:
loadscript Beeper
reset()
beeper.enable = beeper.ON
beeper.beep(2, 2400)
endscript

When you load the file MyScript1.tsp from the flash drive, a script named Beeper is created in
the runtime environment. Note that the script is named using the name that follows the loadscript
keyword, not the name of the TSP file on the flash drive. After the script is loaded, you can choose to
save it to nonvolatile memory.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

If the loaded file does not contain loadscript and endscript keywords, or if no name is included
after the loadscript keyword, the code is loaded as the anonymous script. Loading an unnamed script
overwrites the existing anonymous script. For example, if a file named MyScript2.tsp contains
only the following code, the script is loaded as the anonymous script:
reset()
beeper.enable = beeper.ON
beeper.beep(2, 2400)

The file must be a valid script file. If not, an error message is posted and no further action is taken.
You can view the errors on the front panel of the instrument.
To load a script from a USB flash drive:
1. Insert the flash drive into the USB port on the instrument.
2. Select the MENU key.
3. Select the SCRIPT option.
4. Select the LOAD option.
5. Select the USB1 option. A menu is displayed that lists the TSP files and directories on the
flash drive.
6. If the files are in a directory, use the navigation wheel to select the directory. A new menu is
displayed that lists the TSP files and directories in that directory.
7. Use the navigation wheel to select the TSP file you want to load.
8. If the script has the same name as a script that is already in memory, you are prompted to
overwrite the script.
▪

Select Yes to continue.

▪

Select No to return to the list of files. You must select a file to continue.

9. The SCRIPT ACTION menu is displayed. You can select:
▪

SAVE-INTERNAL: Save the file to nonvolatile memory. This is the same as sending
scriptVar.save() with no parameters.

▪

ACTIVE-FOR-RUN: Set the script to run from the RUN button.

10. Loading is complete. To return to the MAIN menu, press EXIT (LOCAL) until the MAIN menu
is displayed.
11. If you selected ACTIVE-FOR-RUN, you can select RUN to run the script.

The entries in the SCRIPT ACTION menu depend on whether the script that was loaded is a named
script or the anonymous script. If it is a named script, both SAVE-INTERNAL and ACTIVE-FOR-RUN
appear in the menu. If it is the anonymous script, then only ACTIVE-FOR-RUN appears in the menu.

Section 8: Instrument programming

Run scripts
This section describes how to run the anonymous and named scripts.
On the front panel, items are available through the USER menu if you explicitly add them to the menu.
The items the menu selections represent can be scripts, function calls, or instrument commands.
Items in the menus are referred to as scripts in this section.
The SCRIPTS menu lists the names of scripts in nonvolatile memory or scripts that have been added
to the runtime environment. The anonymous script also appears in this menu.

If the instrument is in local control when the script is started, it switches to remote control (REM is
displayed) while the script is running. The instrument is returned to local control when the script
completes. If you press the front-panel EXIT (LOCAL) key while the script is running, the script
is stopped.

Run the anonymous script
The anonymous script can be run many times without reloading it. It remains in the runtime
environment until a new anonymous script is created or until the instrument is turned off.
To run the anonymous script, use any one of these commands:

•

run()

•

script.run()

•

script.anonymous()

•

script.anonymous.run()

Run a named script
You can run any named script that is in the runtime environment using one of the following
commands:

•

scriptVar()

•

scriptVar.run()

Where scriptVar is the user-defined name of the script.
When a script is named, it can be accessed using the global variable scriptVar.
To run a named script from TSB Embedded, select the script from the User Scripts list and click Run.
Example: Run a named script
test3()

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

If the script test3 is loaded into the runtime environment, the
instrument executes test3.

Run a user script from the instrument front panel
From the front panel, you can load and run a script that was previously added to the USER menu.
To run the code from the front panel and add it to the USER menu:
1. Select the LOAD key.
2. Select USER.
3. Select the script from list and press the ENTER key. The script is loaded into the
runtime environment.

If you are used to using print in Test Script Builder, note that the output of the print commands
using this procedure do not function the same as when you are in Test Script Builder. You may find
that it makes more sense to use Test Script Builder to get the output you need.
4. Press the RUN key to execute.
To run a script directly without adding it to the USER menu:
1. Select the LOAD key.
2. Select SCRIPTS and select the ENTER key. There may be a short pause before a menu is
displayed that represents the scripts in the instrument.
3. Select the script from the list and select the ENTER key. The script is now loaded for front-panel
execution.
4. Press the RUN key to execute.

If you are used to using print in Test Script Builder, note that the output of the prints using this
procedure do not function the same as when you are in Test Script Builder. You may find that it
makes more sense to use Test Script Builder to get the output you need.

Scripts that run automatically
You can set up scripts to run automatically when you power on the instrument. To do this, either set
the autorun attribute for the script to yes (see Autorun scripts (on page 8-9)) or create a script with
the script name autoexec (see Autoexec script (on page 8-9)).

8-8

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 8: Instrument programming

Autoexec script
The autoexec script runs automatically when the instrument is turned on. It runs after all the scripts
have loaded and any scripts defined as autorun have run.
To create a script that executes automatically, create and load a new script and name it autoexec.
See Create and load a script (on page 8-3).

You must save the autoexec script to nonvolatile memory if you want to use it after instrument
power has been turned off and then turned on again. See Save a user script to nonvolatile memory
(on page 8-10) for more detail.
Example: Creating an autoexec script with the loadscript command
loadscript autoexec
display.clear()
display.settext("Hello from autoexec")
endscript
autoexec.save()
Creates the script autoexec.
Saves the autoexec script to nonvolatile memory. The next time the instrument is turned on, Hello from
autoexec is displayed.

Example: Creating an autoexec script using TSB Embedded
display.clear()
display.settext("Hello from autoexec")
In the TSP Script box, enter autoexec.
Enter the code in the entry box.
Click Save Script.
Creates a new script that clears the display when the instrument is turned on and displays Hello from
autoexec.

Autorun scripts
Autorun scripts run automatically when the instrument is turned on. You can set any number of scripts
to autorun. The run order for autorun scripts is arbitrary, so make sure the run order is not important.
As shown in the example below, you can set a script to run automatically by setting the .autorun
attribute of the script to "yes" and then saving the script.
Example:
scriptVar.autorun = "yes"
scriptVar.save()

Where: scriptVar is the user-defined name of the script.
To disable autorun, set the autorun attribute of the script to no and then save the script.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

8-9

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

The scriptVar.save() command saves the script to nonvolatile memory, which makes the
change persistent through a power cycle. See Save a user script to nonvolatile memory (on page
8-10) for more detail.
Example: Set a script to run automatically
test5.autorun = "yes"
test5.save()
Assume a script named test5 is in the runtime environment.
The next time the instrument is turned on, test5 script automatically loads and runs.

Working with scripts in nonvolatile memory
The Fundamentals of scripting for TSP (on page 8-1) section in this manual describes working with
scripts, primarily in the runtime environment. You can also work with scripts in nonvolatile memory.
The runtime environment and nonvolatile memory are separate storage areas in the instrument. The
information in the runtime environment is lost when the instrument is turned off. The nonvolatile
memory remains intact when the instrument is turned off. When the instrument is turned on,
information in nonvolatile memory is loaded into the runtime environment.

Save a user script
You can save scripts to nonvolatile memory using commands or TSB Embedded.
Only named scripts can be saved to nonvolatile memory. The anonymous script must be named
before it can be saved to nonvolatile memory.

If a script is not saved to nonvolatile memory, the script is lost when the instrument is turned off.
To save a script to nonvolatile memory from a remote interface:
1. Create and load a named script (see Create and load a script (on page 8-3)).
2. Send the command scriptVar.save(), where scriptVar is the name of the script.
To save a script to nonvolatile memory using TSB Embedded:
Select Save Script.
Example: Save a user script to nonvolatile memory
test1.save()
Assume a script named test1 has been loaded. test1 is saved into nonvolatile memory.

To save a script to an external USB flash drive using a remote interface:

When you save a script to a USB flash drive, you do not need to specify a file extension. The
extension .tsp is automatically added. If you do specify a file extension, it must be .tsp. An error
occurs if you use any other file extension.
1. Load a script (see Create and load a script (on page 8-3)).
2. Send the command scriptVar.save("/usb1/filename.tsp"), where scriptVar is the
variable referencing the script and filename.tsp is the name of the file.
To save a script to an external USB flash drive or other accessible drive using TSB Embedded:
Load the script and select Export to PC.

Save the anonymous script as a named script
To save the anonymous script to nonvolatile memory, you must name it first.
To save the anonymous script as a named script:
1. To name the script, send the command script.anonymous.name = "myTest" (where myTest
is the name of the script).
2. Send the script.anonymous.save() command to save myTest to nonvolatile memory.

Save a script from the instrument front panel
You can save scripts from the runtime environment to nonvolatile memory or the USB port on the
instrument front panel.

If you want to save the anonymous script to nonvolatile memory, you must name it first. See Save
the anonymous script as a named script (on page 8-11).
To save a script to nonvolatile memory from the front panel:
1. Select the MENU key.
2. Select the SCRIPT option.
3. Select the SAVE option.
A list of the scripts available to save is displayed. It may take a few seconds to display. The
displayed list is from the script.user.scripts table in the instrument.
4. Turn the navigation wheel to select the script that you want to save.
5. Select INTERNAL. Press the navigation wheel. The script is saved to nonvolatile memory using
the name attribute of the script.
6. Press EXIT (LOCAL) several times to return to the Main Menu.

Delete user scripts

These steps remove a script from nonvolatile memory. To completely remove a script from the
instrument, there are additional steps you must take. See Delete user scripts from the instrument (on
page 8-81).
To delete a script from nonvolatile memory using a remote interface:
You can delete the script from nonvolatile memory by sending either of the following commands:

•

script.delete("name")

•

script.user.delete("name")

Where: name is the user-defined name of the script.
Example: Delete a user script from nonvolatile memory
script.delete("test8")

Delete a user script named test8 from nonvolatile memory.

To delete a script from nonvolatile memory using TSB Embedded:
1. In TSB Embedded, select the script from the User Scripts list.
2. Click Delete. There is no confirmation message.

Programming example: Interactive script
An interactive script prompts the operator to input values using front panel controls. The following
example script uses display messages to prompt the operator to:

•

Enter the voltage level to source

•

Enable or disable measurements

•

Set the number of readings if measurements are enabled

After the operator completes entering values, the output turns on and sources the specified value. If
measurements were enabled, a message indicates that measurements are in progress. Another
message is displayed when the source-measure operation is complete. If measurements were not
enabled, the message indicates that the source operation is complete.
When an input prompt is displayed, the script waits until the operator inputs the parameter or presses
the ENTER key. The example shown here assumes that you are using TSB or TSB Embedded. If you
are using a remote interface, you need to add the loadscript and endscript commands to the
example code. See Load a script by sending commands over the remote interface (on page 8-4)
for details.

Fundamentals of programming for TSP
To conduct a test, a computer (controller) is programmed to send sequences of commands to an
instrument. The controller orchestrates the actions of the instrumentation. The controller is typically
programmed to request measurement results from the instrumentation and make test sequence
decisions based on those measurements.
To use the advanced features of the instrument, you can add programming commands to your scripts.
Programming commands control script execution and provide tools such as variables, functions,
branching, and loop control.
The Test Script Processor (TSP®) scripting engine is a Lua interpreter. In TSP-enabled instruments,
the Lua programming language has been extended with Keithley-specific instrument
control commands.

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

What is Lua?
Lua is a programming language that can be used with TSP-enabled instruments. Lua is an efficient
language with simple syntax that is easy to learn.
Lua is also a scripting language, which means that scripts are compiled and run when they are sent to
the instrument. You do not compile them before sending them to the instrument.

Lua basics
This section contains the basics about the Lua programming language to allow you to start adding
Lua programming commands to your scripts quickly.
For more information about Lua, see the Lua website (lua.org). Another source of useful information
is the Lua users group (lua-users.org), created for and by users of Lua programming language.

Comments
You can start a comment anywhere outside a string by typing a double hyphen (--). If the text
immediately after -- is anything other than double left brackets ([[), the comment is a short
comment, which continues until the end of the line.
If -- is followed by [[, the following characters are a long comment, which continues until double
right brackets (]]) close the comment. Long comments may continue for several lines and may
contain nested [[ . . . ]] pairs. The example below shows how to use code comments.
An example of a short comment is:
-- Turn off the front-panel display.

An example of a long comment is:
--[[Display a menu with three menu items. If the second menu item is selected,
the selection is given the value Test2.]]

Function and variable name restrictions
You cannot use factory script names, functions created by factory scripts, Lua reserved words and
top-level command names for function or variable names.
For information on factory script names, see Factory scripts (on page 7-20).

8-14

You also cannot use top-level command names as variable names. If you use these names, it results
in the loss of use of the commands. For example, if you send the command digio = 5, you cannot
access the digio.* commands until you turn the instrument power off and then turn it on again.

Values and variable types
In Lua, you use variables to store values in the runtime environment for later use.
Lua is a dynamically-typed language; the type of the variable is determined by the value that is
assigned to the variable.
Variables in Lua are assumed to be global unless they are explicitly declared to be local. A global
variable is accessible by all commands. Global variables do not exist until they have been assigned
a value.

Variable types
Variables can be one of the following types.
Variable types and values
Variable type returned

Value

Notes

"nil"

not declared

"boolean"

true or false

The type of the value nil, whose main property is
to be different from any other value; usually it
represents the absence of a useful value.
Boolean is the type of the values false and true.
In Lua, both nil and false make a condition
false; any other value makes it true.

"number"

number

"string"
"function"

sequence of words or
characters
a block of code

"table"

an array

"userdata"

variables

"thread"

line of execution

All numbers are real numbers; there is no
distinction between integers and floating-point
numbers.

Functions perform a task or compute and return
values.
New tables are created with { } braces.
For example:
{1, 2, 3.00e0}
Allows arbitrary program data to be stored in Lua
variables.

To determine the type of a variable, you can call the type() function, as shown in the
examples below.

The output you get from these examples may vary depending on the data format that is set.
Example: Nil
x = nil
print(x, type(x))

nil

Example: Boolean
y = false
print(y, type(y))

Delete a global variable
To delete a global variable, assign nil to the global variable. This removes the global variable from
the runtime environment.

Functions
With Lua, you can group commands and statements using the function keyword. Functions can
take zero, one, or multiple parameters, and they return zero, one, or multiple values.
You can use functions to form expressions that calculate and return a value. Functions can also act
as statements that execute specific tasks.
Functions are first-class values in Lua. That means that functions can be stored in variables, passed
as arguments to other functions, and returned as results. They can also be stored in tables.
Note that when a function is defined, it is stored in the runtime environment. Like all data that is
stored in the runtime environment, the function persists until it is removed from the runtime
environment, is overwritten, or the instrument is turned off.

Create functions using the function keyword
Functions are created with a message or in Lua code in either of the following forms:
function myFunction(parameterX) functionBody end
myFunction = function (parameterX) functionBody end

Where:

•

myFunction: The name of the function.

•

parameterX: Parameter names. To use multiple parameters, separate the names with commas.

•

functionBody: The code that is executed when the function is called.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

8-17

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

To execute a function, substitute appropriate values for parameterX and insert them into a message
formatted as:
myFunction(valueForParameterX, valueForParameterY)

Where valueForParameterX and valueForParameterY represent the values to be passed to
the function call for the given parameters.

The output you get from these examples may vary depending on the data format settings of the
instrument.
Example 1
function add_two(first_value, second_value)
return first_value + second_value
end
print(add_two(3, 4))

Creates a variable named add_two that has a
variable type of function.
Output:

Example 2
add_three = function(first_value,
second_value, third_value)
return first_value + second_value +
third_value
end
print(add_three(3, 4, 5))

Creates a variable named add_three that has a
variable type of function.
Output:

Example 3
function sum_diff_ratio(first_value,
second_value)
psum = first_value + second_value
pdif = first_value - second_value

end
sum, diff, ratio = sum_diff_ratio(2, 3)

Section 8: Instrument programming

Create functions using scripts
You can use scripts to define functions. Scripts that define a function are like any other script: They
do not cause any action to be performed on the instrument until they are executed. The global
variable of the function does not exist until the script that created the function is executed.
A script can consist of one or more functions. Once a script has been run, the computer can call
functions that are in the script directly.

The following steps use TSB Embedded. You can also use the loadscript and endscript
commands to create the script over the remote interface. See Load a script by sending commands
over the remote interface (on page 8-4).
Steps to create a function using a script:
1. In TSB Embedded, enter a name into the TSP Script box. For example, type MakeMyFunction.
2. Enter the function as the body of the script. This example concatenates two strings:
MyFunction = function (who)
print ("Hello".. who)
end
3. Select Save Script.
4. MakeMyFunction is now on the instrument in a global variable with the same name as the script
(MakeMyFunction). However, the function defined in the script does not yet exist because the
script has not been executed.
5. Run the script as a function. For this example, send:
MakeMyFunction()
This instructs the instrument to run the script, which creates the MyFunction global variable.
This variable is of the type "function" (see Variable types (on page 8-16)).
6. Run the new function with a value.
MyFunction("world")
The response message is:
Hello world.

Group commands using the function keyword
The following script contains instrument commands that display the name of the person that is using
the script on the front panel of the instrument. It takes one parameter to represent this name. When
this script is run, the function is loaded in memory. Once loaded into memory, you can call the
function outside of the script to execute it.
When calling the function, you must specify a string for the name argument of the function. For
example, to set the name to John, call the function as follows:
myDisplay("John")

Example: User script
User script created in Test Script Builder or
TSB Embedded
function myDisplay(name)
display.clear()
display.settext(
name .. "$N is here!")
end

User script created in a different program
loadscript
function myDisplay(name)
display.clear()
display.settext(
name .. " $N is here!")
end
endscript

Section 8: Instrument programming

Logical operators
The logical operators in Lua are and, or, and not. All logical operators consider both false and
nil as false and anything else as true.
The operator not always returns false or true.
The conjunction operator and returns its first argument if the first argument is false or nil;
otherwise, and returns its second argument. The disjunction operator or returns its first argument if
this value is different from nil and false; otherwise, or returns its second argument. Both and and
or use shortcut evaluation, that is, the second operand is evaluated only if necessary.

The example output you get may vary depending on the data format settings of the instrument.
Example
print(10 or errorqueue.next())
print(nil or "a")
print(nil and 10)
print(false and errorqueue.next())
print(false and nil)
print(false or nil)
print(10 and 20)

Description

..

Concatenates two strings. If either argument is a number, it is coerced to a string (in a
reasonable format) before concatenation.

Example: Concatenation
print(2 .. 3)
print("Hello " .. "World")
Output:

Operator precedence
Operator precedence in Lua follows the order below (from higher to lower priority):

•

^ (exponentiation)

•

not, - (unary)

•

*, /

•

+, –

•

.. (concatenation)

•

<, >, <=, >=, ~=, ==

•

and

•

or

You can use parentheses to change the precedences in an expression. The concatenation ("..") and
exponentiation ("^") operators are right associative. All other binary operators are left associative. The
examples below show equivalent expressions.
Equivalent expressions

reading^(testAdjustment^2)

Conditional branching
Lua uses the if, else, elseif, then, and end keywords to do conditional branching.
Note that in Lua, nil and false are false and everything else is true. Zero (0) is true in Lua.
The syntax of a conditional block is as follows:
if expression then
block
elseif expression then
block
else
block
end

Where:

8-22

•

expression is Lua code that evaluates to either true or false

•

block consists of one or more Lua statements

Section 8: Instrument programming

Example: If
if 0 then
print("Zero is true!")
else
print("Zero is false.")
end

Output:
Zero is true!

Example: Comparison
x = 1
y = 2
if x and y then
print("Both x and y are true")
end

Output:
Both x and y are true

Example: If and else
x = 2
if not x then
print("This is from the if block")
else
print("This is from the else block")
end

Output:
This is from the else block

Example: Else and elseif
x = 1
y = 2
if x and y then
print("'if' expression 2 was not false.")
end
if x or y then
print("'if' expression 3 was not false.")
end
if not x then

Loop control
If you need to repeat code execution, you can use the Lua while, repeat, and for control
structures. To exit a loop, you can use the break keyword.

While loops
To use conditional expressions to determine whether to execute or end a loop, you use while loops.
These loops are similar to Conditional branching (on page 8-22) statements.
while expression do
block
end

Where:

•

expression is Lua code that evaluates to either true or false

•

block consists of one or more Lua statements

The output you get from this example may vary depending on the data format settings of
the instrument.
Example: While
list = {
"One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six"}
print("Count list elements on numeric index:")
element = 1
while list[element] do
print(element, list[element])
element = element + 1
end

This loop exits when list[element] =
nil.
Output:
Count list elements on
numeric index:
1
One
2
Two
3
Three
4
Four
5
Five
6
Six

Repeat until loops
To repeat a command, you use the repeat ... until statement. The body of a repeat statement
always executes at least once. It stops repeating when the conditions of the until clause are met.
repeat
block
until expression

Where:

8-24

•

block consists of one or more Lua statements

•

expression is Lua code that evaluates to either true or false

Section 8: Instrument programming

The output you get from this example may vary depending on the data format settings of the
instrument.
Example: Repeat until
list = {"One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six"}
print("Count elements in list using repeat:")
element = 1
repeat
print(element, list[element])
element = element + 1
until not list[element]
Output:
Count elements in list
using repeat:
1 One
2 Two
3 Three
4 Four
5 Five
6 Six

For loops
There are two variations of for statements supported in Lua: Numeric and generic.

In a for loop, the loop expressions are evaluated once, before the loop starts.
The output you get from these examples may vary depending on the data format settings of the
instrument.

for element = 1, 3 do
print(element, list[element])
end
print("Counting from one to four, in steps of two:")
for element = 1, 4, 2 do
print(element, list[element])
end
The numeric for loop repeats a block of code while a control variable runs through an arithmetic progression.
Output:
Counting from one to three:
1

Two
3
Three
Counting from one to four, in steps of two:
1

Example: Generic for
days = {"Sunday",
"Monday",
"Tuesday",
"Wednesday", "Thursday",
"Friday",
"Saturday"}
for i, v in ipairs(days) do
print(days[i], i, v)
end
The generic for statement works by using functions called iterators. On each iteration, the iterator function is
called to produce a new value, stopping when this new value is nil.
Output:

Section 8: Instrument programming

Break
The break statement terminates the execution of a while, repeat, or for loop, skipping to the
next statement after the loop. A break ends the innermost enclosing loop.
Return and break statements can only be written as the last statement of a block. If it is necessary to
return or break in the middle of a block, an explicit inner block can be used.

The output you get from these examples may vary depending on the data format settings of the
instrument.
Example: Break with while statement
local
local

while
if

numTable = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
k = table.getn(numTable)
breakValue = 3
k > 0 do
numTable[k] == breakValue then
print("Going to break and k = ", k)
break

This example defines a break value
(breakValue) so that the break statement is
used to exit the while loop before the value of
k reaches 0.
Output:
Going to break and k = 3

end
k = k - 1
end
if k == 0 then
print("Break value not found")
end

Example: Break with while statement enclosed by comment delimiters
local numTable = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
local k = table.getn(numTable)
-- local breakValue = 3
while k > 0 do
if numTable[k] == breakValue then
print("Going to break and k = ", k)
break
end
k = k - 1
end
if k == 0 then
print("Break value not found")
end

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

This example defines a break value
(breakValue), but the break value line is
preceded by comment delimiters so that the
break value is not assigned, and the code
reaches the value 0 to exit the while loop.
Output:
Break value not found

Example: Break with infinite loop
a, b = 0, 1
while true do
print(a, b)
a, b = b, a + b
if a > 500 then

Tables and arrays
Lua makes extensive use of the data type table, which is a flexible array-like data type. Table indices
start with 1. Tables can be indexed not only with numbers, but with any value except nil. Tables can
be heterogeneous, which means that they can contain values of all types except nil.
Tables are the sole data structuring mechanism in Lua. They may be used to represent ordinary
arrays, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, and so on. To represent records, Lua uses the
field name as an index. The language supports this representation by providing a.name as an easier
way to express a["name"].

The output you get from this example may vary depending on the data format settings of the
instrument.
Example: Loop array
atable = {1, 2, 3, 4}
i = 1
while atable[i] do
print(atable[i])
i = i + 1
end

Defines a table with four numeric elements.
Loops through the array and prints each element.
The Boolean value of atable[index] evaluates to
true if there is an element at that index. If there is
no element at that index, nil is returned (nil is
considered to be false).

Section 8: Instrument programming

Standard libraries
In addition to the standard programming constructs described in this document, Lua includes
standard libraries that contain useful functions for string manipulation, mathematics, and related
functions. Test Script Processor (TSP®) scripting engine instruments also include instrument control
extension libraries, which provide programming interfaces to the instrumentation that can be
accessed by the TSP scripting engine. These libraries are automatically loaded when the TSP
scripting engine starts and do not need to be managed by the programmer.
The following topics provide information on some of the basic Lua standard libraries. For additional
information, see the Lua website (lua.org).

When referring to the Lua website, please be aware that the TSP scripting engine uses Lua 5.0.2.

Base library functions
Base library functions
Function

Description

collectgarbage()
collectgarbage(limit)

Sets the garbage-collection threshold to the given limit (in kilobytes) and
checks it against the byte counter. If the new threshold is smaller than the
byte counter, Lua immediately runs the garbage collector. If there is no limit
parameter, it defaults to zero (0), which forces a garbage-collection cycle.
See Lua memory management (on page 8-29) for more information.
Returns the number of kilobytes of dynamic memory that the Test Script
Processor (TSP®) scripting engine is using and returns the present
garbage collector threshold (also in kilobytes). See Lua memory
management (on page 8-29) for more information.
Returns x converted to a number. If x is already a number, or a convertible
string, the number is returned; otherwise, it returns nil.
An optional argument specifies the base to use when interpreting the
numeral. The base may be any integer from 2 to 36, inclusive. In bases
above 10, the letter A (in either upper or lower case) represents 10, B
represents 11, and so forth, with Z representing 35. In base 10, the default,
the number may have a decimal part and an optional exponent. In other
bases, only unsigned integers are accepted.
Receives an argument of any type and converts it to a string in a
reasonable format.
Returns (as a string) the type of its only argument. The possible results of
this function are "nil" (a string, not the value nil), "number",
"string", "boolean", "table", "function", "thread",
and "userdata".

Lua memory management
Lua automatically manages memory, which means you do not have to allocate memory for new
objects and free it when the objects are no longer needed. Lua occasionally runs a garbage collector
to collect all objects that are no longer accessible from Lua. All objects in Lua are subject to automatic
management, including tables, variables, functions, threads, and strings.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

8-29

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Lua uses two numbers to control its garbage-collection cycles. One number counts how many bytes
of dynamic memory Lua is using; the other is a threshold. When the number of bytes crosses the
threshold, Lua runs the garbage collector, which reclaims the memory of all inaccessible objects. The
byte counter is adjusted, and the threshold is reset to twice the new value of the byte counter.

String library functions
This library provides generic functions for string manipulation, such as finding and extracting
substrings. When indexing a string in Lua, the first character is at position 1 (not 0, as in ANSI C).
Indices may be negative and are interpreted as indexing backward from the end of the string. Thus,
the last character is at position –1, and so on.
String library functions
Function

Description

string.byte(s)
string.byte(s, i)
string.byte(s, i, j)
string.char(···)

Returns the internal numeric codes of the characters s[i], s[i+1],
···, s[j]. The default value for i is 1; the default value for j is i.

string.format(
formatstring, ...)

string.len(s)

Receives a string and returns its length. The empty string "" has length 0.
Embedded zeros are counted, so "a\000bc\000" has length 5.

string.lower(s)

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all uppercase letters
changed to lowercase. All other characters are left unchanged.
Returns a string that is the concatenation of n copies of the string s.
Returns the substring of s that starts at i and continues until j; i and j
can be negative. If j is absent, it is assumed to be equal to -1 (which is
the same as the string length). In particular, the call string.sub(s, 1,
j) returns a prefix of s with length j, and string.sub(s, -i) returns a
suffix of s with length i.

string.rep(s, n)
string.sub(s, i)
string.sub(s, i, j)

string.upper(s)

8-30

Receives zero or more integers separated by commas. Returns a string
with length equal to the number of arguments, in which each character has
the internal numeric code equal to its corresponding argument.
Returns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following
the description given in its first argument, which must be a string. The
format string follows the same rules as the printf family of standard C
functions. The only differences are that the modifiers *, l, L, n, p, and h
are not supported and there is an extra option, q. The q option formats a
string in a form suitable to be safely read back by the Lua interpreter; the
string is written between double quotes, and all double quotes, newlines,
embedded zeros, and backslashes in the string are correctly escaped
when written.
For example, the call:
string.format('%q', 'a string with "quotes" and \n new
line')
produces the string:
"a string with \"quotes\" and \
new line"
The options c, d, E, e, f, g, G, i, o, u, X, and x all expect a number as
argument. q and s expect a string. This function does not accept string
values containing embedded zeros, except as arguments to the q option.

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all lowercase letters
changed to uppercase. All other characters are left unchanged.

Password management
The 2600B has password capabilities that let you decide how to password protect the instrument.
Password protection prevents unauthorized access to any remote interface and reserves the
instrument exclusively for your use.
When password usage is enabled, you must supply a password to change the configuration or to
control an instrument from a remote command interface.

Section 8: Instrument programming

Setting the password from a command or web interface
The attribute localnode.passwordmode enables passwords and sets the mode. The password
mode identifies which interface to password protect.
Set this attribute to one of the values below to enable password checking:

•

localnode.PASSWORD_NONE or 0: Disable passwords everywhere

•

localnode.PASSWORD_WEB or 1: Use passwords on the web interface only

•

localnode.PASSWORD_LAN or 2: Use passwords on the web interface and all LAN interfaces

•

localnode.PASSWORD_ALL or 3: Use passwords on the web interface and all remote
command interfaces

When a password is set for the web interface, you cannot make changes using the web interface
options Virtual Front Panel, Flash Upgrade, or TSB Embedded.
The password lock feature on 2600B is similar to the lock feature on your computer.

You must assign a password to use this feature. Passwords can be up to 255 characters.
To set the password using the web interface:
1. From the web interface, click Set Password.
The LXI - Keithley Instruments - 2600B - Administration page is displayed.
2. In Current Password, type the existing password. The default is admin.
3. In New Password, type the new password.
4. Retype the new password in Confirm New Password.
5. Click Submit.
The LXI Welcome page is displayed.
To enable the password from a command interface:
To lock the instrument when you are away from the testing area, send the following command:
password
The remote interface is locked. The 2600B does not respond to commands issued from the command
interface until you unlock the interface. This reserves the instrument and protects the test script
running on the instrument.

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Unlocking the remote interface
If the remote interface is locked, you must enter the password before the 2600B responds to any
command issued over a remote interface.

The password for the example below is Keithley.
To unlock the remote interface, send the following command:
password Keithley
The 2600B is unlocked and communicates with any remote interface.

Resetting the password
If you forget the password, you can reset the password from the front panel. Once you enable the
password feature, the 2600B stores this password until the LAN configuration is reset or until you
reset the password.
To reset the password:
1. From the front panel, press the MENU key.
2. Select RESET-PASSWORD.

Resetting the LAN settings also resets the password feature. If you reset the LAN settings, you must
re-enable the password feature.

Key-press codes
You can use key codes to remotely simulate pressing a front-panel key or the navigation wheel.
There are also key codes to simulate rotating the navigation wheel to the left or right (one click
at a time).

Sending key codes
Use the display.sendkey() function to remotely simulate pressing a front-panel key or the
navigation wheel. The following programming examples illustrate how to simulate pressing the MENU
key in two different ways:
display.sendkey(display.KEY_MENU)
display.sendkey(68)

Section 8: Instrument programming

Capturing key-press codes
A history of the key code for the last pressed front-panel key is maintained by the 2600B. When the
instrument is turned on (or when transitioning from local to remote operation), the key code is set to 0
(display.KEY_NONE).
When a front-panel key is pressed, the key code value for that key can be captured and returned.
There are two functions associated with the capture of key-press codes: display.getlastkey()
and display.waitkey().

display.getlastkey()
The display.getlastkey() function immediately returns the key code for the last pressed key.
The following programming example illustrates how to display the last key pressed:
key = display.getlastkey()
print(key)

The above code returns the key code value (see the following table). A value of
0 (display.KEY_NONE) indicates that the key code history had been cleared.

display.waitkey()
The display.waitkey() function captures the key code value for the next key press:
key = display.waitkey()

After sending the display.waitkey() function, the script pauses and waits for the operator to
press a front-panel key. For example, if the MENU key is pressed, the function returns the value 68,
which is the key code for that key. The key code values are the same as listed in display.getlastkey()
(on page 9-68).
The following programming example illustrates how to prompt the user to press the EXIT (LOCAL)
key to abort the script, or any other key to continue it:
display.clear()
display.setcursor(1, 1)
display.settext("Press EXIT to Abort")
display.setcursor(2, 1)
display.settext("or any key to continue")
key = display.waitkey()
display.clear()
display.setcursor(1, 1)
if key == 75 then
display.settext("Test Aborted")
exit()
else
display.settext("Test Continuing")
end

The above code captures the key that is pressed by the operator. The key code value for the EXIT
(LOCAL) key is 75. If the EXIT (LOCAL) key is pressed, the script aborts. If any other key is pressed,
the script continues.

Remote communications interfaces
You can choose from one of several communication interfaces to send commands to and receive
responses from the 2600B.
You can control the 2600B from only one communications interface at a time. The first interface on
which the instrument receives a message takes control of the instrument. If another interface sends a
message, that interface can take control of the instrument. You may need to enter a password to
change the interface, depending on the setting of interface access.
The 2600B automatically detects the type of communications interface (LAN, USB, GPIB, or RS-232)
when you connect to the respective port on the rear panel of the instrument. In most cases, you do
not need to configure anything on the instrument. In addition, you do not need to reboot if you change
the type of interface that is connected.

Supported remote interfaces
The 2600B supports the following remote interfaces:

•

USB: Communicate with the instrument over a USB connection.

•

LAN: Local area network (LAN) communications provide the flexibility to build scalable and
functional test or data acquisition systems with a large degree of flexibility.

•

GPIB: General purpose interface bus is an IEEE-488 instrumentation data bus.

•

RS-232: Communicate with the instrument over the serial port or with another instrument using its
serial port.

The 2600B can be controlled from only one communication interface at a time. The first interface
from which it receives a message takes control of the instrument. It ignores the other interfaces until
the instrument is returned to local operation.
For more information about the remote interfaces, see:

•

USB communications (on page 8-39)

Output queue
Response messages, such as those generated from print commands, are placed in the output queue.
All remote command interfaces share the same output queue.
The output queue sets the message available (MAV) bit in the status model.
The data in the output queue is cleared by the *CLS command.

USB communications
To use the rear-panel USB port, you need a driver that communicates using the USBTMC protocol,
such as NI-VISA, on the host computer.
When installed, the USBTMC protocol allows the Microsoft® Windows® operating system to recognize
the instrument.
When you connect a USB device that implements the USBTMC or USBTMC-USB488 protocol to the
computer, the driver automatically detects the device. Note that the driver does not recognize other
USB devices, such as printers, scanners, and storage devices.
In this section, "USB instruments" refers to devices that implement the USBTMC or
USBTMC-USB488 protocol.
See Software components for applications and instrument drivers (on page 8-63) for more information
on drivers.

Communicate with the instrument
When using Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA) to communicate with the USB device,
you need to use a VISA communication driver. VISA requires a resource string in the following format
to connect to the correct USB instrument:
USB[board]::manufacturer ID::model code::serial number[::USB interface
number][::INSTR]
This requires that you determine the parameters. You can gather this information by running a utility
that automatically detects all instruments connected to the computer. If you installed the Keithley I/O
Layer, the Keithley Configuration Panel is available from the Microsoft ® Windows® Start menu in the
Keithley Instruments menu.
To use the Keithley Configuration Panel to determine the VISA resource string:
1. Start the Keithley Configuration Panel. The Keithley Configuration Wizard opens to the Select
Operation dialog box.
2. Complete the wizard.
3. Save the configuration. From the Configuration Utility, select File > Save.
4. Open the Keithley Communicator.

5. Select File > Open Instrument to open the instrument you named in the wizard.
Figure 88: Keithley Communicator Open an Instrument

6. Select OK.
7. Send a command to the instrument and see if it responds.

If you have a full version of NI-VISA on your system, you can run NI-MAX or the VISA Interactive
Utility. See their documentation for information.
If you have the Keysight IO Libraries on your system, you can run Keysight Connection Expert to
review your USB instruments. See their documentation for information.

Connecting multiple USB instruments to the computer
The most convenient way to connect USB instrumentation to the computer is to plug a USB cable
directly from the instrument to the computer. If you have more than one USB instrument or have other
USB devices, such as printers, keyboards, and mice, you might not have enough USB connectors on
the computer.
To gain more ports, you can use a USB hub or add more USB controller cards if you have available
PCI or PCI Express slots.

LAN communications
This section describes how to connect to a LAN.
The 2600B is an LXI version 1.4 Core 2011 compliant instrument that supports TCP/IP and complies
with IEEE Std 802.3 (ethernet). The LAN port on the rear panel of the 2600B supports full connectivity
on a 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps network.

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Selecting a LAN interface protocol
You can use a remote interface protocol to connect to the 2600B. The 2600B provides Telnet, VXI-11,
and raw socket LAN interfaces, with associated LAN protocols (each interface uses a different
protocol). Select the interface based on the protocol needed.
You can also use a dead socket termination interface (DST) to troubleshoot connection problems.

You can only use one remote interface at a time. Although multiple ethernet connections to the
instrument can be opened, only one can be used to control the instrument at a time.

VXI-11 connection
This remote interface is similar to GPIB and supports message boundaries, serial poll, and service
requests (SRQs). A VXI-11 driver or NI-VISA software is required. Test Script Builder (TSB) uses
NI-VISA and can be used with the VXI-11 interface. You can expect a slower connection with
this protocol.

Raw socket connection
All Keithley instruments that have LAN connections support raw socket communication. This means
that you can connect to the TCP/IP port on the instrument and send and receive commands. A
programmer can easily communicate with the instrument using the Winsock API on computers with
the Microsoft® Windows® operating system or using the Berkeley Sockets API on Linux ® or Apple®
computers.
Raw socket is a basic ethernet connection that communicates in a manner similar to RS-232 without
explicit message boundaries. The instrument always terminates messages with a line feed, but
because binary data may include bytes that resemble line-feed characters, it may be difficult to
distinguish between data and line-feed characters.
Use raw socket as an alternative to VXI-11. Raw socket offers a faster connection than VXI-11.
However, raw socket does not support explicit message boundaries, serial poll, and service requests.

Dead socket connection
The dead socket termination (DST) port is used to terminate all existing ethernet connections. A dead
socket is a socket that is held open by the instrument because it has not been properly closed. This
most often happens when the host computer is turned off or restarted without first closing the socket.
This port cannot be used for command and control functions.
Use the dead socket termination port to manually disconnect a dead session on any open socket. All
existing ethernet connections are terminated and closed when the connection to the dead socket
termination port is closed.

Telnet connection
The Telnet protocol is similar to raw socket and can be used when you need to interact directly with
the instrument. Telnet is often used for debugging and troubleshooting. You need a separate Telnet
program to use this protocol.
The 2600B supports the Telnet protocol, which you can use over a TCP/IP connection to send
commands to the instrument. You can use a Telnet connection to interact with scripts or send
real-time commands.
Configuring a Telnet connection
This procedure uses PuTTY, which is open source, cross-platform, and usable under the MIT license.

GPIB operation
The following topics contain information about GPIB standards, bus connections, and primary
address selection.

GPIB standards
The GPIB is the IEEE-488 instrumentation data bus, which uses hardware and programming
standards originally adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) in 1975.
The instrument is IEEE Std 488.1 compliant and supports IEEE Std 488.2 common commands and
status model topology.

Connect the GPIB cable
To connect an instrument to the GPIB bus, use a cable equipped with standard IEEE-488 connectors,
as shown below.
Figure 96: GPIB connector

To allow many parallel connections to one instrument, stack the connectors. Each connector has two
screws on it to ensure that connections remain secure. The figure below shows a typical connection
diagram for a test system with multiple instruments.

To avoid possible mechanical damage, stack no more than three connectors on any one
instrument. To minimize interference caused by electromagnetic radiation, use only shielded
IEEE-488 cables. Contact Keithley Instruments for shielded cables.
To connect the instrument to the IEEE-488 bus, line up the cable connector with the connector on the
rear panel. Install and tighten the screws securely, making sure not to overtighten them. The following
figure shows the location of the connector.

Section 8: Instrument programming

Figure 97: IEEE-488 connections

Figure 98: IEEE-488 connector location

Connect any additional connectors from other instruments as required for your application. Make sure
the other end of the cable is properly connected to the controller. You can have up to 15 devices
connected to a GPIB interface, including the controller. The maximum cable length is the lesser
of either:

•

The number of devices multiplied by 2 m (6.5 ft)

•

20 m (65.6 ft)

You may see erratic bus operation if you ignore these limits.

Primary address
The 2600B ships from the factory with a GPIB primary address of 26. If the GPIB interface is enabled,
it momentarily displays the primary address on power-up. You can set the address to a value from 0
to 30, but do not assign the same address to another device or to a controller that is on the same
GPIB bus (controller addresses are usually 0 or 21).
To set or check the primary address from the front panel:
1. Press the MENU key, select GPIB, and then press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
2. Select ADDRESS, then press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
3. Use the navigation wheel to set the primary address to the appropriate value, then press the
ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
4. Press the EXIT (LOCAL) key twice to return to the normal display.

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

To set the primary address remotely:
gpib.address = address

To set the primary address remotely to 20:
gpib.address = 20

Note that changing the GPIB address takes effect when the command is processed. Any response
messages generated after processing this command are sent with the new settings. If command
messages are being queued (sent before this command has executed), the new settings may take
effect in the middle of a subsequent command message, so be careful when setting this attribute from
the GPIB interface.

GPIB terminator
When receiving data over the GPIB, the instrument terminates messages on any line feed character
or any data byte with EOI asserted (line feed with EOI asserted is also valid). When sending data, it
appends a line feed character to all outgoing messages. The EOI line is asserted with the terminating
line feed character.

Front-panel GPIB operation
This section describes aspects of the front panel that are part of GPIB operation, including messages,
status indicators, and the LOCAL key.

Error and status messages
The front-panel display may show error and status messages. The instrument can be programmed to
generate a service request (SRQ), and command queries can be performed to check for specific
error conditions.

Communication status indicators
The remote (REM), talk (TALK), listen (LSTN), and service request (SRQ) indicators show the
communication bus status. Each of these indicators is described in the following table.
Status indicator

REM
This indicator is illuminated when the instrument is in the remote-control state. When the instrument is
in the remote-control state, all front-panel keys, except for the EXIT (LOCAL) key and OUTPUT
ON/OFF control, are locked out. When REM is off, the instrument is in the local-control state and
front-panel operation is restored.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 8: Instrument programming

TALK
This indicator is on when the instrument is in the talker active state. Place the instrument in the talk
state by addressing it to talk with the correct talk command. TALK is off when the instrument is in the
talker idle state. Place the instrument in the talker idle state by sending a UNT (untalk) command,
addressing it to listen, or by sending the IFC (interface clear) command.
LSTN
This indicator is on when the instrument is in the listener active state, which is activated by
addressing the instrument to listen with the correct listen command. LSTN is off when the instrument
is in the listener idle state. Place the instrument in the listener idle state by sending UNL (unlisten),
addressing it to talk, or by sending the IFC (interface clear) command over the bus.
SRQ
You can program the instrument to generate a service request (SRQ) when one or more errors or
conditions occur. When this indicator is on, a service request was generated. This indicator stays on
until all conditions that caused the SRQ are cleared.
Note that while the SRQ indicator turns on when a service request is generated, it reflects the state of
the master summary status (MSS) bit and not the request for service (RQS) bit. Therefore, performing
a serial poll does not turn off the indicator. To turn off the indicator, you must use *CLS or
status.reset() to clear all the conditions that caused the MSS bit to be set.

The SRQ applies to all available communication buses. However, actual service requests only apply
to GPIB, USB, and VXI-11.
For additional information on using the SRQ, refer to Status byte and service request (SRQ) (on
page 12-15).

LOCAL key
The EXIT(LOCAL) key cancels the remote state and restores local operation of the instrument.
Pressing the EXIT (LOCAL) key turns off the REM indicator and returns the display to normal if a
user-defined message was displayed. Pressing the EXIT (LOCAL) key or the OUTPUT ON/OFF
control also aborts any commands or scripts that are being processed.
If the LLO (local lockout setting) command is in effect, the EXIT (LOCAL) key is inoperative. For
safety reasons, you can use the OUTPUT ON/OFF control to turn the output off while in LLO.

RS-232 interface operation
The following topics contain information about configuring RS-232 communication parameters,
sending or receiving command messages, and requesting or retrieving data. To control the 2600B,
connect a controller or personal computer to the 2600B RS-232 interface. Alternatively, you can use
the 2600B to control another device over RS-232.

Setting RS-232 interface parameters
To set interface parameters from the front panel:
1. Press the MENU key, select RS232, and then press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
2. Select and enter the following interface parameters:
▪

BAUD: Set baud rate (see Baud rate (on page 8-61))

▪

BITS: Set number of bits (see Data bits and parity (on page 8-61))

▪

PARITY: Set parity

▪

FLOW-CTRL: Set Flow control and signal handshaking (on page 8-61)

▪

ENABLE: Enable or disable the RS-232 interface

3. Press the EXIT (LOCAL) key twice to return to the normal display.

Remote RS-232 parameters
Commands to set RS-232 parameters are listed in the following table.
RS-232 interface commands

Description

serial.baud = baud

Set baud rate (300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200,
38400, 57600, 115200)
Set number of bits (7 or 8)

serial.databits = bits
serial.flowcontrol = flow

Set flow control:
serial.FLOW_NONE (no flow control)
serial.FLOW_HARDWARE (hardware flow control)

serial.parity = parity

Set parity:
serial.PARITY_NONE (no parity)
serial.PARITY_EVEN (even parity)
serial.PARITY_ODD (odd parity)

Changes to a serial port setting take effect when the command is processed. Any response
messages generated after the commands are processed are sent with the new settings. If command
messages are being queued (sent before the commands have executed), the new settings may take
effect in the middle of a subsequent command message, so be careful when setting these attributes
from the RS-232 interface.

RS-232 programming example
The programming example below illustrates how to set the baud rate to 9600 with no flow control:
serial.baud = 9600
serial.flowcontrol = serial.FLOW_NONE

Section 8: Instrument programming

Sending and receiving data
The RS-232 interface transfers data using 7 or 8 data bits; 1 stop bit; and no, even, or odd parity.
Make sure the device you connect to the 2600B also uses the same settings.

RS-232 terminator
When receiving data over the RS-232 interface, the command interface terminates on line feeds. A
line feed is appended to all output messages when the RS-232 interface is used as a command
interface.
Sending data using the serial.write() function does not append a terminator. Be sure to append
the appropriate terminator to the message before sending it.

Baud rate
The baud rate is the rate at which the 2600B and the programming terminal communicate. Select one
of the following available rates:

▪
▪
▪
▪

115200
57600
38400
19200

▪
▪
▪
▪

9600
4800

▪
▪

600
300

2400
1200

The factory-selected baud rate is 9600.
Both the 2600B and the programming terminal must be configured for the same baud rate. Make sure
the device connected to the 2600B RS-232 port can support the selected baud rate.

Data bits and parity
The RS-232 interface can be configured to send/receive data that is 7 or 8 bits long using even, odd,
or no parity.

Flow control and signal handshaking
Signal handshaking between the controller and the instrument allows the two devices to communicate
to each other to determine if they are ready to receive data.
The RS-232 interface provides two control lines (request to send and clear to send) for this purpose.
The instrument asserts the RTS signal when it is admissible for the computer to transmit to the
instrument. It sends information to the computer when the CTS signal is asserted by the computer.

RS-232 connections
Connect the RS-232 serial port of the 2600B to the serial port of a computer using a straight-through
RS-232 cable terminated with DB-9 connectors. Do not use a null modem cable. The serial port uses
the transmit (TXD), receive (RXD), CTS and RTS (if flow control is enabled), and signal ground (GND)
lines of the RS-232 standard. The connector location is shown in Remote communications interfaces
(on page 8-36).
If your computer uses a DB-25 connector for the RS-232 interface, you need a standard cable or
adapter with a DB-25 connector on one end and a DB-9 connector on the other.

Software components for applications and instrument drivers
The majority of software applications and all instrument drivers from Keithley Instruments depend on
the following software components:

•

NI-VISA

•

VISA shared components

•

IVI shared components

•

NI CVI runtime engine

•

NI IVI compliance package

•

Keithley instrument driver

These software components are available for download from the Product Support and Downloads
web page (tek.com/product-support).

Instrument driver types
There are several different styles of instrument drivers. Keithley Instruments provides the following
instrument drivers for the 2600B:

•

A native LabVIEW driver

•

An IVI-C driver

•

An IVI-COM driver

You need to pick the style that best suits the application development environment (ADE) that you are
using. For example, if you are using LabVIEW, pick a native LabVIEW driver. If a native LabVIEW
driver is not available, you can use an IVI-C driver because LabVIEW has the option of creating a
wrapper for the IVI-C driver.
LabVIEW supports IVI-COM drivers, but they are not preferred. However, if they are the only driver
types available for the instrument, they can be used.
If LabWindows/CVI or C/C++ is your programming language, an IVI-C driver is the best option. For
Microsoft® Visual Basic® 6.0 and any .NET language (C#, VB.NET, and so on), an IVI-COM driver is
the best option.
Sometimes instrument vendors do not provide all three driver types. Most languages can
accommodate other driver types, but this is not optimal.
The following sections describe the different driver types in more detail.

VXIPnP drivers
VXIplug&play (VXIPnP) style drivers are Win32 DLLs that have some standard functions defined by
the IVI Foundation (ivifoundation.org), such as:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

init
close
error_message
reset
self_test
read
initiate
fetch
abort

The application programming interface (API) was defined so that users of instruments have a familiar
API from instrument to instrument. There are some basic guidelines when creating APIs for your
instrument, such as using VISA data types and how to construct the CVI hierarchy.

LabVIEW drivers
Native LabVIEW drivers
A native LabVIEWTM driver is a LabVIEW driver that is created using entirely built-in LabVIEW VIs. It
does not make any calls to external DLLs or Library files. This makes the driver portable to all the
platforms and operating systems that LabVIEW and VISA supports (such as Linux ® on x86, Mac
OS® X, and Microsoft® Windows®).
LabVIEW driver wrappers
All IVI-C drivers have a function panel file (file name extension .fp) that shows a hierarchy of the
function calls into a DLL. It is a tool that guides a user to select the correct function call in the driver,
because a DLL only has a flat API entry point scheme (unlike COM or .NET).
Any CVI-generated .fp files can be imported into LabVIEW and LabVIEW generates a wrapper for the
DLL. The drawback here is that the driver is dependent on the DLL, which is not portable and is
therefore specific to the Windows operating system.

Getting instrument drivers
To see what drivers are available for your instrument:
1. Go to the Product Support and Downloads web page (tek.com/product-support).
2. Enter the model number of your instrument.
3. Select Software from the list.
4. Select and download the file.
For LabVIEWTM, you can also go to the National Instruments website and search their instrument
driver database.

Section 8: Instrument programming

Instrument driver examples
All Keithley drivers come with examples written in several programming languages that show you how
to do common tasks with the instruments. The examples are available in the drivers and through Test
Script Builder.

IVI shared components
The IVI shared components are similar in concept to the VISA shared components. The IVI
Foundation provides class drivers for:

•

All the supported instruments (DMM, Scope, Fgen, and so on)

•

The configuration store

The IVI shared components also create the installation folders and registry keys that all IVI drivers
and support files use for installation.

Interchangeable Virtual Instruments (IVI) style drivers
The IVI Foundation (ivifoundation.org) defined a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) for
instruments, including digital multimeters, arbitrary waveform/function generators, dc power supplies,
ac power supplies, oscilloscopes, switches, spectrum analyzers, RF signal generators, and
power meters.
There are two types of IVI drivers, IVI-COM and IVI-C. IVI-COM drivers use Microsoft® COM
technology to expose driver functionality. IVI-C drivers use conventional Microsoft ® Windows® DLLs
to export simple C-based functions.
For more information about IVI drivers and the differences between the COM, C, and .NET interfaces,
see Understanding the Benefits of IVI
(ivifoundation.org/docs/Understanding%20the%20Benefits%20of%20IVI[3].pdf).

NI CVI runtime engine
IVI-C drivers that are created using the National Instruments (NITM) LabWindows/CVI environment
depend on either the CVI runtime DLL (cvirte.dll) or the instrument support runtime DLL
(instrsup.dll). These DLLs must be present on the system for them to run.

NI IVI Compliance Package
The National Instruments (NITM) IVI Compliance Package (ICP) is a software package that contains
IVI class drivers and support libraries that are needed for the development and use of applications
that leverage IVI instrument interchangeability. The IVI Compliance Package also is based on and is
compliant with the latest version of the instrument programming specifications defined by the
IVI Foundation.
The NI ICP installer installs the IVI shared components, CVI runtime engine, and the instrument
support runtime engine.

The installation files for the TSB software are available at tek.com/keithley.
To install the TSB software:
1. Close all programs.
2. Download the installer to your computer and double-click the .exe file to start the installation.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

Using Test Script Builder (TSB)
Keithley Instruments Test Script Builder (TSB) is a software tool that simplifies building test scripts.
You can use TSB to perform the following operations:

•

Send remote commands and Lua statements

•

Receive responses (data) from commands and scripts

•

Upgrade instrument firmware

•

Create, manage, and run user scripts

•

Debug scripts

•

Import factory scripts to view or edit and convert to user scripts

The Keithley Instruments Test Script Processor (TSP®) scripting engine is a Lua interpreter. In
TSP-enabled instruments, the Lua programming language has been extended with Keithley-specific
instrument control commands. For more information about using the Lua scripting language with
Keithley TSP-enabled instruments, refer to the Fundamentals of programming for TSP (on
page 8-13).
Keithley has created a collection of remote commands specifically for use with Keithley TSP-enabled
instruments; for detailed information about those commands, refer to the "Command reference"
section of the documentation for your specific instrument. You can build scripts from a combination of
these commands and Lua programming statements. Scripts that you create are referred to as "user
scripts." Also, some TSP-enabled instruments include built-in factory scripts.

Programming interaction
This part of the workspace is where you interact with the scripts that you are building in Test Script
Builder (TSB). The actual contents of the programming interaction area of the workspace can vary.
You can send commands from the Instrument Console command line, retrieve data, view variables
and errors, and view and set breakpoints when using the debug feature. For additional information,
refer to the online help that is accessible from Test Script Builder (TSB).

Working with TSB Embedded
TSB Embedded is a script management tool that is available through the web interface of the
instrument. You can use TSB Embedded to create, modify, and save test scripts, and to send
individual commands. TSB Embedded provides some of the features of Test Script Builder (TSB).
TSB is a software tool that simplifies building test scripts for Keithley Instruments that are enabled to
use Test Script Processor (TSP®). You can also use TSB Embedded to send individual commands to
the instrument.

For more information on scripts, refer to Fundamentals of scripting for TSP (on page 8-1).

Advanced scripting for TSP
The following topics describe advanced information that can help you understand how the Test Script
Processor (TSP®) scripting engine works.

Global variables and the script.user.scripts table
When working with script commands, it is helpful to understand how scripts are handled in
the instrument.
Scripts are loaded into the runtime environment from nonvolatile memory when you turn the
instrument on. They are also added to the runtime environment when you load them into
the instrument.
A script in the runtime environment can be:

•

A named script

•

An unnamed script

•

The anonymous script (which is a special unnamed script)

Script names can be assigned by using the loadscript command or by defining the scriptVar
parameter of the script.new() function. When a named script is loaded into the
runtime environment:

8-74

•

A global variable with the same name is created so that you can reference the script
more conveniently.

•

An entry for the script is added to the script.user.scripts table.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 8: Instrument programming

When you create a script using the script.new() function without providing a name, the script is
added to the runtime environment as an unnamed script. The script.new() function returns the
script, but the script is not added to the script.user.scripts table.
When the anonymous script is loaded, it does not have a global variable or an entry in the
script.user.scripts table. If there is an existing anonymous script, it is replaced by the
new one.
When the instrument is turned off, everything in the runtime environment is deleted, including the
scripts and global variables.
See the figure below to see how the scripts, global variables, and script.user.scripts
table interrelate.

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Create a script using the script.new() command
Use the script.new() function to copy an existing script from the local node to a remote node. This
enables parallel script execution.
You can create a script with the script.new() function using the command:
scriptVar = script.new(code, name)

Where:
scriptVar
code
name

=
=
=

Name of the variable created when the script is loaded into the runtime environment
Content of the script
Name that is added to the script.user.scripts table

For example, to set up a two-second beep, you can send the command:
beepTwoSec = script.new("beeper.enable = 1 beeper.beep(2, 2400)", "beepTwoSec")

To run the new script, send the command:
beepTwoSec()

When you add beepTwoSec, the global variable and script.user.scripts table entries are
made to the runtime environment, as shown in the following figure.
Figure 103: Runtime environment after creating a script

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 8: Instrument programming

Create an unnamed script using script.new()

Unnamed scripts are not available from the front-panel display of the instrument. Only the
anonymous script and named scripts are available from the front-panel display.
When you create a script using script.new(), if you do not include name, the script is added to the
runtime environment as an unnamed script. The script.new() function returns the script. You can
assign it to a global variable, a local variable, or ignore the return value. A global variable is not
automatically created.
For example, send the following command:
hello = script.new('display.clear() display.settext("hello")')

A script is created in the runtime environment and a global variable is created that references
the script.
To run the script, send the command:
hello()

Figure 104: Create an unnamed script

A script becomes unnamed if you create a new script with the same name. In this circumstance, the
name of the script in the script.user.scripts table is set to an empty string before it is replaced
by the new script.
For example, if beepTwoSec already exists in the script.user.scripts table and you sent:
beepTwoSec1200 = script.new("beeper.enable = 1 beeper.beep(2, 1200)", "beepTwoSec")

The following actions occur:

•

beepTwoSec1200 is added as a global variable.

•

The script that was in the runtime environment as beepTwoSec is changed to an unnamed script
(the name attribute is set to an empty string).

•

The global variable beepTwoSec remains in the runtime environment unchanged (it points to the
now unnamed script).

•

A new script named beepTwoSec is added to the runtime environment.

8-77

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

In this example, you can access the new script by sending either of the following commands:
beepTwoSec1200()
script.user.scripts.beepTwoSec()

To access the unnamed script, you can send the command:
beepTwoSec()

Figure 105: Create a new script with the name of an existing script

Rename a script
You can rename a script. You might want to rename a script if you need to name another script the
same name as the existing script. You could also rename an existing script to be the autoexec script.
To change the name of a script, use the command:
scriptVar.name = "renamedScript"

Where:
scriptVar
"renamedScript"

=
=

The global variable name
The new name of the user script that was referenced by the
scriptVar global variable

After changing the name, you need to save the original script to save the change to the
name attribute.
For example:
beepTwoSec.name = "beep2sec"
beepTwoSec.save()

8-78

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 8: Instrument programming

Run the beep2sec script using the following command:
script.user.scripts.beep2sec()

If the new name is the same as a name that is already used for a script, the name of the existing
script is removed and that script becomes unnamed. This removes the existing script if there are no
other variables that reference the previous script. If variables do reference the existing script, the
references remain intact.
Changing the name of a script does not change the name of any variables that reference that script.
After changing the name, the script is in the script.user.scripts table under its new name.
Figure 106: Rename script

For example, to change the name of the script named test2 to be autoexec:
test2.name = "autoexec"
test2.save()

The autoexec script runs automatically when the instrument is turned on. It runs after all the scripts
have loaded and any scripts marked as autorun have run.

You can also use the script.new() and the scriptVar.source attribute commands to create a
script with a new name. For example, if you had an existing script named test1, you could create a
new script named test2 by sending the command:
test2 = script.new(test1.source, "test2")
See script.new() (on page 9-181).

Retrieve a user script
There are several ways to retrieve the source code of a user script:

•

One line at a time: Use scriptVar.list() to retrieve the source code one line at a time

•

Entire script: Use the print(scriptVar.source) command to retrieve the script source code
as a single string

•

Use TSB Embedded; refer to Working with TSB Embedded (on page 8-70) for more information

See Create and load a script (on page 8-3) for information about recreating the script and loading it
back into the instrument.

To get a list of scripts that are in nonvolatile memory, use the script.user.catalog() (on
page 9-184) function.

Retrieve source code one line at a time
To retrieve the source code one line at a time, send the scriptVar.list() command. When this
command is received, the instrument sends the entire script. Each line of the script is sent as a
separate response message. The output includes the loadscript or loadandrunscript and
endscript keywords.
After retrieving the source code, you can modify and save the command lines as a user script under
the same name or a new name.
To retrieve the source code of a script one line at a time, send the command:
scriptVar.list()

Where scriptVar is the name of the script.

To retrieve the commands in the anonymous script, use script.anonymous.list().
Example: Retrieve source code one line at a time
test.list()

Retrieve the source of a script named "test".
The output looks similar to:

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 8: Instrument programming

Retrieve a script as a single string
To retrieve the entire user script source code as a single string, use the scriptVar.source
attribute. The loadscript or loadandrunscript and endscript keywords are not included.
To retrieve the source code as a single string, send the command:
print(scriptVar.source)

Where scriptVar is the name of the script.
Example: Retrieve the source code as a single string
print(test.source)

Retrieve the source of a script named "test".
Output looks similar to:
display.clear() display.settext("This is a test") print("This
is a test")

Delete user scripts from the instrument
In most circumstances, you can delete a script using script.delete() (as described in Delete
user scripts (on page 8-12)), and then turn the instrument off and back on again. However, if you
cannot turn the instrument off, you can use the following steps to completely remove a script from the
instrument.
When you completely remove a script, you delete all references to the script from the runtime
environment, the script.user.scripts table, and nonvolatile memory.
To completely remove a script:
1. Remove the script from the runtime environment. Set any variables that refer to the script to
nil or assign the variables a different value. For example, to remove the script "beepTwoSec"
from the runtime environment, send the following code:
beepTwoSec = nil
2. Remove the script from the script.user.scripts table. Set the name attribute to an empty
string (""). This makes the script nameless, but does not make the script become the anonymous
script. For example, to remove the script named "beepTwoSec", send the following code:
script.user.scripts.beepTwoSec.name = ""
3. Remove the script from nonvolatile memory. To delete the script from nonvolatile memory,
send the command:
script.delete("name")
Where name is the name that the script was saved as. For example, to delete "beepTwoSec",
send:
script.delete("beepTwoSec")

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Restore a script to the runtime environment
You can retrieve a script that was removed from the runtime environment but is still saved in
nonvolatile memory.
To restore a script from nonvolatile memory into the runtime environment, you can use
script.restore("scriptName"), where scriptName is the user-defined name of the script to
be restored.
For example, to restore a user script named "test9" from nonvolatile memory:
script.restore("test9")

Memory considerations for the runtime environment
The 2600B reserves 32 MB of memory for dynamic runtime use. Approximate allocation of this
memory is shown below:
5 MB
1 MB
2 MB
24 MB

Firmware general operation
Reserve for instrument internal operation
Reserve for future firmware updates
Runtime environment, user-created reading buffers, and active sweep configuration

Note that the runtime environment, user-created reading buffers, and active sweep configuration must
fit in the 24 MB of memory that is available. The amount of memory used by a reading buffer is
approximately 15 bytes for each entry requested.
Reading buffers also use a small amount of memory for reading buffer management, which is not
significant when making memory utilization calculations. For example, assume two reading buffers
were created. One of them was created to store up to 1,000 readings and the other to store up to
2,500 readings. The memory reserved for the reading buffers is calculated as follows:
(1000 * 15) + (2500 * 15) = 52,500 bytes or 52.5 kilobytes
Note that the dedicated reading buffers do not consume memory that is needed by the runtime
environment; do not include them in your memory consumption calculations. Also, reading buffers for
remote nodes consume memory on the remote node, not the local node. Make sure the total reading
buffer memory for any particular remote node does not exceed 24 MB, but do not include that amount
in your local memory consumption calculations.
The amount of memory used by a sweep configuration is based on the number of source points. The
actual memory consumption can vary greatly depending on the source-measure unit (SMU) settings,
but as a general rule, each source point can be expected to consume at least 24 bytes.
It is possible for the memory used for the runtime environment, sweep configuration and reading
buffers to exceed 24 MB. When this occurs, there is a risk that memory allocation errors will occur
and commands will not be executed as expected.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 8: Instrument programming

If the instrument encounters memory allocation errors when the memory used is above 95
percent, the state of the instrument cannot be guaranteed. After attempting to save any
important data, turn off power to the instrument and turn it back on to reset the runtime
environment and return the instrument to a known state. Unsaved scripts and data in reading
buffers will be lost.
The amount of memory in use can be checked using the meminfo() function. The first value
returned by meminfo() is the number of kilobytes of memory in use.
If the amount of memory used is over 95 percent or if you receive out-of-memory errors, you should
reduce the amount of memory that is used.
Some suggestions for increasing the available memory:

•

Turn the instrument off and on. This deletes scripts that have not been saved and reloads only
scripts that have been stored in nonvolatile memory.

•

Remove unneeded scripts from nonvolatile memory. Scripts are loaded from nonvolatile memory
into the runtime environment when the instrument is turned on. See Delete user scripts from the
instrument (on page 8-81).

•

Reduce the number of TSP-Link® nodes.

•

Delete unneeded global variables from the runtime environment by setting them to nil.

•

Set the source attribute of all scripts to nil.

•

Adjust the collectgarbage() settings in Lua. See Lua memory management (on page 8-29)
for more information.

•

Review scripts to optimize their memory usage. In particular, you can see memory gains by
changing string concatenation lines into a Lua table of string entries. You can then use the
table.concat() function to create the final string concatenation.

TSP-Link system expansion interface
TSP-Link® is not available on the 2604B, 2614B, and 2634B.
The TSP-Link® expansion interface allows the 2600B instrument to communicate with other Test
Script Processor (TSP®) enabled instruments. The test system can be expanded to include up to 32
TSP-Link enabled instruments.

Combining two 2600B instruments to achieve greater currents in both source voltage and
source current applications requires specific precautions, including configuration settings.
Make sure that you adequately understand the risks involved and the measures needed to
accommodate the combination of two 2600B instruments. To prevent damage to the 2600B,
connected instruments, and the device under test, make sure proper procedures are used.
For further information, visit the Keithley website at tek.com/keithley for application notes on
combining two 2600B channels.

Master and subordinates
In a TSP-Link system, one of the nodes (instruments) is the master node and the other nodes are the
subordinate nodes. The master node in a TSP-Link system can control the other nodes (subordinates)
in the system.
When any node transitions from local operation to remote operation, it becomes the master of the
system. All other nodes also transition to remote operation and become its subordinates. When any
node transitions from remote operation to local, all other nodes also transition to local operation, and
the master/subordinate relationship between nodes is dissolved.
The expanded system can be stand-alone or computer-based.
Stand-alone system: You can run a script from the front panel of any instrument (node) connected to
the system. When a script is run, all nodes in the system go into remote operation (REM indicators
turn on). The node running the script becomes the master and can control all other nodes, which
become its subordinates. When the script is finished running, all the nodes in the system return to
local operation (REM indicators turn off), and the master/subordinate relationship between nodes
is dissolved.
Computer-based system: You can use a computer and a remote communications interface to any
single node in the system. This node becomes the interface to the entire system. When a command is
sent through this node, all nodes go into remote operation (REM indicators turn on). The node that
receives the command becomes the master and can control all other nodes, which become its
subordinates. In a computer-based system, the master/subordinate relationship between nodes can
only be dissolved by performing an abort operation.

TSP-Link nodes
Each instrument (node) attached to the TSP-Link® network must be identified by assigning it a unique
TSP-Link node number.
Commands for remote nodes are stored in the node table. An individual node is accessed as
node[N], where N is the node number assigned to the node.
All TSP-accessible remote commands can be accessed as elements of the specific node. The
following attributes are examples of items you can access:

•

node[N].model: The product model number string of the node.

•

node[N].revision: The product revision string of the node.

•

node[N].serialno: The product serial number string of the node.

You do not need to know the node number of the node that is running a script. The variable
localnode is an alias for the node entry of the node where the script is running. For example, if a
script is running on node 5, you can use the global variable localnode as an alias for node[5]. To
access the product model number for this example, use localnode.model.

Connections
Connections for an expanded system are shown in the following figure. As shown, one instrument is
optionally connected to the computer using the GPIB, LAN, USB, or RS-232 interface.
All the instruments in the system are connected in a sequence (daisy-chained) using LAN
crossover cables. The cables used for TSP-Link connections must be category 5e or higher and less
than three meters between nodes.
Details about these computer communication connections are described in Remote communications
interfaces (on page 8-36). You can use TSP-Link without a host computer.

Initialization
Before you can use a TSP-Link® system, it must be initialized. For initialization to succeed, each
instrument in a TSP-Link system must be assigned a different node number.

Assigning node numbers
At the factory, each 2600B instrument is assigned as node 1. The node number is stored in
nonvolatile memory and remains in storage when the instrument is turned off. You can assign a node
number to a 2600B using the front panel or by using a remote command. Note that there can only be
32 physical nodes, but you can assign node numbers from 1 to 64.
To assign a node number from the front panel of the instrument:
1. Press the MENU key, then select TSPLINK > NODE.
2. Press the navigation wheel and select the node number.
3. Press the ENTER key to save the number.
To assign a node number using a remote command:
Set the tsplink.node attribute of the instrument:
tsplink.node = N

Where N = 1 to 64
To determine the node number of an instrument, you can read the tsplink.node attribute by
sending the following command:
print(tsplink.node)

The above print command outputs the node number. For example, if the node number is 1, a 1
is displayed.

Resetting the TSP-Link network
After all the node numbers are set, you must initialize the system by performing a TSP-Link®
network reset.

If you change the system configuration after initialization, you must reinitialize the system by
performing a TSP-Link network reset. Changes that require that you reinitialize the TSP-Link network
include turning off power or rebooting any instrument in the system, or rearranging or disconnecting
the TSP-Link cable connections between instruments.

tsplink.reset()

Initializes the TSP-Link network

tsplink.state

Reads the state of the TSP-Link network:

▪
▪

“online” if the most recent TSP-Link reset was successful
“offline” if the reset operation failed

An attempted TSP-Link reset operation fails if any of the following conditions are true:

•

Two or more instruments in the system have the same node number

•

There are no other instruments connected to the instrument performing the reset (only if the
expected number of nodes was not provided in the reset call)

•

One or more of the instruments in the system is turned off

•

If the actual number of nodes is less than the expected number

The programming example below illustrates a TSP-Link reset operation and displays its state:
tsplink.reset()
print(tsplink.state)

If the reset operation is successful, online is output to indicate that communications with all nodes
have been established.

Accessing nodes
A TSP-Link® reset command populates the node table. Each instrument in the system corresponds to
an entry in this table. Each entry is indexed by the node number of the instrument. The variable
node[N] (where N is the node number) is used to access any node in the system. For example,
node 1 is represented as entry node[1] in the node table.
You can access all the remote commands for a specific node by adding node[N]. to the beginning
of the remote command, where N is the node number. For example, to set the NPLC value for the
source-measure unit (SMU) A on node 1 to 0.1, you could send this command:
node[1].smua.measure.nplc = 0.1

The variable localnode is an alias for node[N], where N is the node number of the node on which
the code is running. For example, if node 1 is running the code, you can use localnode instead
of node[1].
The following programming examples illustrate how to access instruments in the TSP-Link system
(shown in TSP-Link connections):

•

•

Any one of the following commands reset SMU A of node 1 (which, in this example, is the master).
The other nodes in the system are not affected.
▪

smua.reset()

▪

localnode.smua.reset()

▪

node[1].smua.reset()

The following command resets SMU A of node 4, which is a subordinate. The other nodes are not
affected.
▪

node[4].smua.reset()

Using the reset() command
Most TSP-Link® system operations target a single node in the system, but the reset() command
affects the system as a whole by resetting all nodes to their default settings:
-- Reset all nodes in a TSP-Link system to their default state.
reset()

Using the reset() command in a TSP-Link network differs from using the tsplink.reset()
command. The tsplink.reset() command reinitializes the TSP-Link network and turns off the
output of any TSP-linked instrument; it may change the state of individual nodes in the system.
Use node[N].reset() or localnode.reset() to reset only one of the nodes. The other nodes
are not affected. The following programming example shows this type of reset operation with code
that is run on node 1.
-- Reset node 1 only.
node[1].reset()
-- Reset the node you are connected to (in this case, node 1).
localnode.reset()
-- Reset node 4 only.
node[4].reset()

Using the abort command
An abort command terminates an executing script and returns all nodes to local operation (REM
indicators turn off). This dissolves the master/subordinate relationships between nodes. To invoke an
abort operation, either send an abort command to a specific node or press the EXIT (LOCAL) key
on any node in the system.
You can also perform an abort operation by pressing the OUTPUT ON/OFF control on any node. The
results are the same as above, with the addition that all source-measure unit (SMU) outputs in the
system are turned off.

Triggering with TSP-Link
The TSP-Link® expansion interface has three trigger lines that function similarly to the digital I/O
synchronization lines. See Digital I/O (on page 4-38) and Triggering (on page 4-1) for
more information.

TSP advanced features
Use the Test Script Processor (TSP®) scripting engine's advanced features to:

•

Run test scripts simultaneously

•

Manage resources allocated to test scripts that are running simultaneously

•

Use the data queue to facilitate real-time communication between nodes on the TSP-Link®
network

When test scripts are run simultaneously, it improves functional testing, provides higher throughput,
and expands system flexibility.
There are two methods you can use to run test scripts simultaneously:

•

Create multiple TSP-Link networks

•

Use a single TSP-Link network with groups

The following figure displays the first method, which consists of multiple TSP-Link networks. Each
TSP-Link network has a master node and a remote connection to the computer.

Another method you can use to run simultaneous test scripts is to use groups with a single TSP-Link
network. Each group on the TSP-Link network can run a test while other groups are running
different tests.
A group consists of one or more nodes with the same group number. The following figure displays a
single TSP-Link network with groups. This method requires one TSP-Link network and a single GPIB
connection to the computer.

Using groups to manage nodes on TSP-Link network
The primary purpose of groups is to allow each group to run a different test script simultaneously.
A group can consist of one or more nodes. You must assign group numbers to each node using
remote commands. If you do not assign a node to a group, it defaults to group 0, which is always
grouped with the master node (regardless of the group to which the master node is assigned).

Master node overview
You can assign the master node to any group. You can also include other nodes in the group that
includes the master. Note that any nodes that are set to group 0 are automatically included in the
group that contains the master node, regardless of the group that is assigned to the master node.
The master node is always the node that coordinates activity on the TSP-Link network.
The master node:

•

Is the only node that can use the execute() command on a remote node

•

Cannot initiate remote operations on any node in a remote group if any node in that remote group
is performing an overlapped operation (a command that continues to operate after the command
that initiated it has finished running)

•

Can execute the waitcomplete() command to wait for the group to which the master node
belongs; to wait for another group; or to wait for all nodes on the TSP-Link network to complete
overlapped operations (overlapped commands allow the execution of subsequent commands
while device operations of the overlapped command are still in progress)

Group leader overview
Each group has a dynamic group leader. The last node in a group that performs any operation
initiated by the master node is the group leader.
The group leader:

•

Performs operations initiated by the master node

•

Initiates remote operations on any node with the same group number

•

Cannot initiate remote operations on any node with a different group number

•

Can use the waitcomplete() command without a parameter to wait for all overlapped
operations running on nodes in the same group

Assigning groups
Group numbers can range from zero (0) to 64. The default group number is 0. You can change the
group number at any time. You can also add or remove a node to or from a group at any time.
Each time the power for a node is turned off, the group number for that node changes to 0.
The following example code dynamically assigns a node to a group:
-- Assign node 3 to group 1.
node[3].tsplink.group = 1

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 8: Instrument programming

Running simultaneous test scripts
You can send the execute() command from the master node to initiate a test script and Lua code
on a remote node. The execute() command places the remote node in the overlapped operation
state. As a test script runs on the remote node, the master node continues to process other
commands simultaneously.
Use the following code to send the execute() command for a remote node. The N parameter
represents the node number that runs the test script (replace N with the node number).
To set the global variable "setpoint" on node N to 2.5:
node[N].execute("setpoint = 2.5")

The following code demonstrates how to run a test script that is defined on the local node. For this
example, scriptVar is defined on the local node, which is the node that initiates the code to run on
the remote node. The local node must be the master node.
To run scriptVar on node N:
node[N].execute(scriptVar.source)

The programming example below demonstrates how to run a test script that is defined on a remote
node. For this example, scriptVar is defined on the remote node.
To run a script defined on the remote node:
node[N].execute("scriptVar()")

It is recommended that you copy large scripts to a remote node to improve system performance. See
Copying test scripts across the TSP-Link network (on page 8-94) for more information.

Coordinating overlapped operations in remote groups
All overlapped operations on all nodes in a group must have completed before the master node can
send a command to the group. If you send a command to a node in a remote group when an
overlapped operation is running on any node in that group, errors occur.
You can execute the waitcomplete() command on the master node or group leader to wait for
overlapped operations. The action of waitcomplete() depends on the parameters specified.
If you want to wait for completion of overlapped operations for:

•

All nodes in the local group: Use waitcomplete() without a parameter from the master node
or group leader.

•

A specific group: Use waitcomplete(N) with a group number as the parameter from the
master node. This option is not available for group leaders.

•

All nodes in the system: Use waitcomplete(0) from the master node. This option is not
available for group leaders.

For additional information, refer to waitcomplete() (on page 9-415).

Section 8: Instrument programming

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

The following code shows two examples of using the waitcomplete() command from the
master node:
-- Wait for each node in group N to complete all overlapped operations.
waitcomplete(N)
-- Wait for all groups on the TSP-Link network to complete overlapped operations.
waitcomplete(0)

A group leader can issue the waitcomplete() command to wait for the local group to complete all
overlapped operations.
The following code is an example of how to use the waitcomplete() command from a
group leader:
-- Wait for all nodes in the local group to complete all overlapped operations.
waitcomplete()

Using the data queue for real-time communication
Nodes that are running test scripts at the same time can store data in the data queue for real-time
communication. Each instrument has an internal data queue that uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
structure to store data. You can use the data queue to post numeric values, strings, and tables.
Use the data queue commands to:

•

Share data between test scripts running in parallel

•

Access data from a remote group or a local node on a TSP-Link network at any time

You cannot access the reading buffers or global variables from any node in a remote group while a
node in that group is performing an overlapped operation. However, you can use the data queue to
retrieve data from any node in a group that is performing an overlapped operation. In addition, the
master node and the group leaders can use the data queue to coordinate activities.
Tables in the data queue consume one entry. When a node stores a table in the data queue, a copy
of the data in the table is made. When the data is retrieved from the data queue, a new table is
created on the node that is retrieving the data. The new table contains a separate copy of the data in
the original table, with no references to the original table or any subtables.
You can access data from the data queue even if a remote group or a node has overlapped
operations in process. See the dataqueue commands for more information.

Copying test scripts across the TSP-Link network
To run a large script on a remote node, copy the test script to the remote node to increase the speed
of test script initiation.
The code in the example below copies a test script across the TSP-Link® network, creating a copy of
the script on the remote node with the same name.

-- Add the source code from the script

-- Create a new script on the remote node
-- using the source code from testScript.
node[2].execute(testScript.name ..
"= script.new(dataqueue.next(), [[" .. testScript.name .. "]])")

Removing stale values from the reading buffer cache
The node that acquires the data also stores the data for the reading buffer. To optimize data access,
all nodes can cache data from the node that stores the reading buffer data.
When you run Lua code remotely, it can cause reading buffer data that is held in the cache to
become stale. If the values in the reading buffer change while the Lua code runs remotely, another
node can hold stale values. Use the clearcache() command to clear the cache. For additional
detail on the reading buffer cache commands, see bufferVar.cachemode (on page 9-19) and
bufferVar.clearcache() (on page 9-21).
The following example code demonstrates how stale values occur and how to use the clearcache()
command to clear the cache on node 2, which is part of group 7.
-- Create a reading buffer on a node in a remote group.
node[2].tsplink.group = 7
node[2].execute("rbremote = smua.makebuffer(20)" ..
"smua.measure.count = 20 " ..
"smua.measure.v(rbremote)")
-- Create a variable on the local node to
-- access the reading buffer.
rblocal = node[2].getglobal("rbremote")
-- Access data from the reading buffer.
print(rblocal[1])
-- Run code on the remote node that updates the reading buffer.
node[2].execute("smua.measure.v(rbremote)")
-- Use the clearcache command if the reading buffer contains cached data.
rblocal.clearcache()
-- If you do not use the clearcache command, the data buffer
-- values never update. Every time the print command is
-- issued after the first print command, the same data buffer
-- values print.

TSP-Net
The TSP-Net® library allows the 2600B to control LAN-enabled devices directly through its LAN port.
This enables the 2600B to communicate directly with a device that is not TSP ® enabled without the
use of a controlling computer.

TSP-Net capabilities
The TSP-Net library permits the 2600B to control a remote instrument through the LAN port for both
Test Script Processor (TSP®) and non-TSP instruments. Using TSP-Net library methods, you can
transfer string data to and from a remote instrument, transfer and format data into Lua variables, and
clear input buffers. The TSP-Net library is only accessible using commands from a remote command
interface.
You can use TSP-Net commands to communicate with any ethernet-enabled instrument. However,
specific TSP-Net commands exist for TSP-enabled instruments to allow for support of features unique
to the TSP scripting engine. These features include script downloads, reading buffer access, wait
completion, and handling of TSP scripting engine prompts.
Using TSP-Net commands with TSP-enabled instruments, a 2600B can download a script to another
TSP-enabled instrument and have both instruments run scripts independently. The 2600B can read
the data from the remote instrument and either manipulate the data or send the data to a different
remote instrument on the LAN. You can simultaneously connect to a maximum of 32 devices using
standard TCP/IP networking techniques through the LAN port of the 2600B.

Using TSP-Net with any ethernet-enabled instrument
Refer to TSP command reference (on page 9-1) for details about the commands presented in
this section.
The 2600B LAN port is auto-sensing (Auto-MDIX), so you can use either a LAN crossover cable or a
LAN straight-through cable to connect directly from the 2600B to an ethernet device or to a hub.
To set up communication to a remote ethernet-enabled instrument that is TSP® enabled:
1. Send the following command to configure TSP-Net to send an abort command when a
connection to a TSP instrument is established:
tspnet.tsp.abortonconnect = 1

If the scripts are allowed to run, the connection is made, but the remote instrument may be busy.

8-96

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 8: Instrument programming

2. Send the command:
connectionID = tspnet.connect(ipAddress)

Where:
▪

connectionID is the connection ID that is used as a handle in all other TSP-Net function
calls.

▪

ipAddress is the IP address, entered as a string, of the remote instrument.

See tspnet.connect() (on page 9-399) for additional detail.
To set up communication to a remote ethernet-enabled device that is not TSP enabled:
Send the command:
connectionID = tspnet.connect(ipAddress, portNumber, initString)

Where:
▪

connectionID is the connection ID used as a handle in all other tspnet function calls.

▪

ipAddress is the IP address, entered as a string, of the remote device.

▪

portNumber is the port number of the remote device.

▪

initString is the initialization string that is to be sent to ipAddress.

See tspnet.connect() (on page 9-399) for additional detail.
To communicate to a remote ethernet device from the 2600B:
1. Connect to the remote device using one of the above procedures. If the 2600B cannot make a
connection to the remote device, it generates a timeout event. Use tspnet.timeout to set the
timeout value. The default timeout value is 20 s.
2. Use tspnet.write() or tspnet.execute() to send strings to a remote device. If you use:
▪

tspnet.write(): Strings are sent to the device exactly as indicated, and you must supply
any needed termination characters.

▪

tspnet.execute(): The 2600B appends termination characters to all strings that are sent.
Use tspnet.termination() to specify the termination character.

3. To retrieve responses from the remote instrument, use tspnet.read(). The 2600B suspends
ope2ration until the remote device responds or a timeout event is generated. To check if data is
available from the remote instrument, use tspnet.readavailable().
4. Disconnect from the remote device using the tspnet.disconnect() function. Terminate all
remote connections using tspnet.reset().

Example script
The following example demonstrates how to connect to a remote device that is not TSP ® enabled,
and send and receive data from this device.

TSP-Net compared to TSP-Link to communicate with TSP-enabled
devices
The TSP-Link® network interface is the preferred communication method for most applications where
communication occurs between the 2600B and another TSP-enabled instrument.
One of the advantages of using the TSP-Link network interface is that TSP-Link connections have
three trigger lines that are available to each device on the TSP-Link network. You can use any one of
the trigger lines to perform hardware triggering between devices on the TSP-Link network. Refer to
Hardware trigger modes (on page 4-30) for details.
However, if the distance between the 2600B and the TSP-enabled device is longer than 15 feet, use
TSP-Net commands.

TSP command programming notes
This section contains general information about using TSP commands.

Placeholder text
This manual uses italicized text to represent the parts of remote commands that must be replaced by
user specified values. The following examples show typical uses of italicized text.
Example 1:
beeper.enable = state
Where state can be a value (beeper.ON or beeper.OFF) or an integer (1 or 0) that you specify.
For example, to set this attribute on, you send one of the following commands:
beeper.enable = beeper.ON
beeper.enable = 1
Example 2:
digio.trigger[N].assert()
Where N is an integer (1 to 14) that you specify. For example, to assert trigger line 7, you send:
digio.trigger[7].assert()
To assert a trigger line with a variable as the integer, you send:
triggerline = 7
digio.trigger[triggerline].assert()

Section 9: TSP command reference

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Example 3:
smuX.trigger.measure.Y(rbuffer)
Where:
X refers to the source-measure unit (SMU) channel (use a for SMU A).
Y is the measurement type that you specify (v, i, r, or p).
rbuffer is the reading buffer object where the readings are stored.
For example, to use SMU A to make voltage measurements and store them in buffer vbuffername,
you send:
smua.trigger.measure.v(vbuffername)

Syntax rules
Use these syntax requirements to build well-formed instrument control commands.
Instrument commands are case sensitive. Refer to the command reference descriptions for the
correct case.
The white space in lists of parameters in functions is optional. For example, the following functions
are equivalent:
digio.writebit(3,0)
digio.writebit (3, 0)

All functions must have a set of parentheses () immediately following the function, even if there are
no parameters specified. For example:
waitcomplete(G)
timezone = localnode.gettimezone()

If there are multiple parameters, they must be separated by commas (,). For example:
beeper.beep(0.5, 2400)

Time and date values
Time and date values are represented as the number of seconds since some base. Representing
time as a number of seconds is referred to as “standard time format.” There are three time bases:

9-2

•

UTC 12:00 am Jan 1, 1970. Some examples of UTC time are reading buffer base timestamps,
adjustment dates, and the value returned by os.time().

•

Instrument on. References time to when the instrument was turned on. The value returned by
os.clock() is referenced to the turn-on time.

•

Event. Time referenced to an event, such as the first reading stored in a reading buffer.

buffer content

▪

bufferVar

1: Append mode on; appends new measurement data to the present
buffer content
The reading buffer; can be a dynamically allocated user-defined buffer or a dedicated
reading buffer

Details
Assigning a value to this attribute enables or disables the buffer append mode. This value can only be
changed with an empty buffer. Use bufferVar.clear() to empty the buffer.
For dedicated reading buffers, all buffer attributes are saved to nonvolatile memory only when the
reading buffer is saved to nonvolatile memory.
If the append mode is set to 0, any stored readings in the buffer are cleared before new ones are
stored. If append mode is set to 1, any stored readings remain in the buffer and new readings are
added to the buffer after the stored readings.
With append mode on, the first new measurement is stored at rb[n+1], where n is the number of
readings stored in buffer rb.
Example
buffer1.appendmode = 1

Append new readings to contents of the reading buffer named
buffer1.

Details
Assigning a value to this attribute enables or disables the reading buffer cache. When enabled, the
reading buffer cache improves access speed to reading buffer data.
If you run successive operations that overwrite reading buffer data, the reading buffer may return
stale cache data. This can happen when initiating successive sweeps without reconfiguring the
sweep measurements or when overwriting data in the reading buffer by setting the
bufferVar.fillmode attribute to smuX.FILL_WINDOW. To avoid this, make sure that you include
commands that automatically invalidate the cache as needed (for example, explicit calls to the
bufferVar.clearcache() function) or disable the cache using this attribute
(bufferVar.cachemode).

bufferVar

The reading buffer; can be a dynamically allocated user-defined buffer or a dedicated

Details
This read-only attribute reads the number of readings that can be stored in the buffer.
For dedicated reading buffers, all buffer attributes are saved to nonvolatile memory only when the
reading buffer is saved to nonvolatile memory.
The capacity of the buffer does not change as readings fill the buffer. A dedicated reading buffer that
only collects basic items can store over 140,000 readings. Turning on additional collection items,
such as timestamps and source values, decreases the capacity of a dedicated reading buffer (for
example, smua.nvbuffer1), but does not change the capacity of a user-defined dynamically
allocated buffer. A user-defined dynamically allocated buffer has a fixed capacity that is set when the
buffer is created.
See the smuX.nvbufferY attribute for details on accessing dedicated reading buffers. See the
smuX.makebuffer() function for information on creating user-defined dynamically allocated
reading buffers.
Example
bufferCapacity = smua.nvbuffer1.capacity
print(bufferCapacity)

Reads the capacity of dedicated reading
buffer 1 (source-measure unit (SMU)
channel A).
Output:
1.49789e+05
The above output indicates that the buffer
can hold 149789 readings.

0: Source value collection disabled (off)
1: Source value collection enabled (on)

The reading buffer; can be a dynamically allocated buffer (user-defined), or a
dedicated reading buffer (such as smua.nvbuffer1)

Details
Assigning a value to this attribute enables or disables the storage of source values. Reading this
attribute returns the state of source value collection. This value can only be changed with an empty
buffer. Empty the buffer using the bufferVar.clear() function.
For dedicated reading buffers, all buffer attributes are saved to nonvolatile memory only when the
reading buffer is saved to nonvolatile memory.
When on, source values are stored with readings in the buffer. This requires four extra bytes of
storage for each reading. Turning on additional collection items, such as source values (this attribute)
and timestamps, decreases the capacity of a dedicated reading buffer, but does not change the
capacity of a user-defined dynamically allocated buffer.
You cannot collect source values when smuX.trigger.measure.action is set to smuX.ASYNC,
so bufferVar.collectsourcevalues must be set to 0 when the measurement action is set to be
asynchronous.
Example
smua.nvbuffer1.collectsourcevalues = 1

Include source values with readings for
dedicated reading buffer 1.

bufferVar

The reading buffer fill count
The reading buffer; can be a dynamically allocated buffer (user-defined), or a
dedicated reading buffer (such as smua.nvbuffer1)

Details
The reading buffer fill count sets the number of readings to store before restarting at index 1. If the
value is zero (0), then the capacity of the buffer is used. Use this attribute to control when the SMU
restarts filling the buffer at index 1, rather than having it restart when the buffer is full.
If the bufferVar.fillcount attribute is set to a value higher than the capacity of the buffer, after
storing the element at the end of the buffer, the SMU overwrites the reading at index 1, the reading
after that overwrites the reading at index 2, and so on.
This attribute is only used when the bufferVar.fillmode attribute is set to smuX.FILL_WINDOW.
For dedicated reading buffers, all buffer attributes are saved to nonvolatile memory only when the
reading buffer is saved to nonvolatile memory.
Example
smua.nvbuffer1.fillcount = 50

Sets fill count of dedicated reading buffer 1
to 50.

reading at index bufferVar.fillcount

The reading buffer; can be a dynamically allocated buffer (user-defined), or a
dedicated reading buffer (such as smua.nvbuffer1)

Details
When this attribute is set to smuX.FILL_ONCE, the reading buffer does not overwrite readings. If the
buffer fills up, new readings are discarded.
When this attribute is set to smuX.FILL_WINDOW, new readings are added after existing data until
the buffer holds bufferVar.fillcount elements. Continuing the sequence, the next reading
overwrites the reading at index 1, the reading after that overwrites the reading at index 2, and so on.
For dedicated reading buffers, all buffer attributes are saved to nonvolatile memory only when the
reading buffer is saved to nonvolatile memory.
Example
smua.nvbuffer1.fillmode = smua.FILL_ONCE
Sets fill mode of dedicated reading buffer 1 to fill once (do not overwrite old data).

Usage
timestamp = bufferVar.timestamps[N]
timestamp

The complete timestamp (including date, time, and fractional seconds) of reading
number N in the specified reading buffer when the reading was acquired

bufferVar

The reading buffer; can be a dynamically allocated user-defined buffer or a dedicated
reading buffer
The reading number (1 to bufferVar.n)

N

Details
The bufferVar.timestamps information from a reading buffer is only available if the
bufferVar.collecttimestamps attribute is set to 1 (default setting). If it is set to 0, you cannot
access any time information from a reading buffer.
If enabled, this buffer recall attribute is like an array (a Lua table) that contains timestamps, in
seconds, of when each reading occurred. These are relative to the bufferVar.basetimestamp for
the buffer.
For dedicated reading buffers, all buffer attributes are saved to nonvolatile memory only when the
reading buffer is saved to nonvolatile memory.
Example
timestamp = smua.nvbuffer1.timestamps[1]

The resulting value of true or false based on the success of the function

value

The data item to add; value can be of any type

timeout

The maximum number of seconds to wait for space in the data queue

Details
You cannot use the timeout value when accessing the data queue from a remote node (you can
only use the timeout value while adding data to the local data queue).
The timeout value is ignored if the data queue is not full.
The dataqueue.add() function returns false:
▪

If the timeout expires before space is available in the data queue

▪

If the data queue is full and a timeout value is not specified

If the value is a table, a duplicate of the table and any subtables is made. The duplicate table does
not contain any references to the original table or to any subtables.
Example
dataqueue.clear()
dataqueue.add(10)
dataqueue.add(11, 2)
result = dataqueue.add(12, 3)
if result == false then
print("Failed to add 12 to the dataqueue")
end
print("The dataqueue contains:")
while dataqueue.count > 0 do
print(dataqueue.next())
end
Clear the data queue.
Each line adds one item to the data queue.
Output:
The dataqueue contains:
10
11
12

digio.TRIG_FALLING or 1

Detects falling-edge triggers as input; asserts a TTL-low pulse

If the programmed state of the line is high, the
digio.TRIG_RISING mode behavior is similar to
digio.TRIG_RISINGA. If the programmed state of the line is

digio.TRIG_RISINGM. Only use this setting if necessary for
compatibility with other Keithley Instruments products.
Detects rising- or falling-edge triggers as input. Asserts a

Detects the falling-edge input triggers and automatically
latches and drives the trigger line low. Asserting the output

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

When programmed to any mode except digio.TRIG_BYPASS, the output state of the I/O line is
controlled by the trigger logic, and the user-specified output state of the line is ignored.
Use of either digio.TRIG_SYNCHRONOUSA or digio.TRIG_SYNCHRONOUSM is preferred over
digio.TRIG_SYNCHRONOUS, because digio.TRIG_SYNCHRONOUS is provided for compatibility
with the digital I/O and TSP-Link triggering on older firmware.
To control the line state, set the mode to digio.TRIG_BYPASS and use the digio.writebit()
and digio.writeport() commands.

digio.trigger[4].mode = 2
Sets the trigger mode for I/O line 4 to digio.TRIG_RISING.

0 (low)
Non-zero (high)

Details
If the output line is write-protected using the digio.writeprotect attribute, the command is
ignored.
The reset() function does not affect the present state of the digital I/O lines.
Use the digio.writebit() and digio.writeport() commands to control the output state of
the synchronization line when trigger operation is set to digio.TRIG_BYPASS.
The data must be zero (0) to clear the bit. Any value other than zero (0) sets the bit.
Example
digio.writebit(4, 0)

Sets digital I/O line 4 low (0).

Bits that are set to one cause the corresponding line to be write-protected.
The binary equivalent of mask indicates the mask to be set for the I/O port. For example, a mask
value of 7 has a binary equivalent of 00000000000111. This mask write-protects lines 1, 2, and 3.
Example
digio.writeprotect = 15

The format parameter uses zeros (0), the decimal point, polarity sign, and exponents to define how
the input field is formatted. The format parameter can include the options shown in the
following table.
Option

Description

Examples

E
+

Include the E to display the value exponentially
Allows operators to enter positive or negative values; if the "+" sign is
not included, the operator cannot enter a negative value
Defines the digit positions for the value; up to six zeros (0)
Include to have a decimal point appear in the value

0.00000e+0
+0.00

0
.

+00.0000e+00
+0.00

The default parameter is the value shown when the value is first displayed.
You can use the minimum and maximum parameters to limit the values that can be entered. When +
is not selected for format, the minimum limit must be more than or equal to zero (0). When limits are
used, you cannot enter values above or below these limits.
The input value is limited to ±1e37.
Before calling display.inputvalue(), you should send a message prompt to the operator using
display.prompt(). Make sure to position the cursor where the edit field should appear.
After this command is sent, script execution pauses until you enter a value and press the ENTER key.
For positive and negative entry (plus sign (+) used for the value field and/or the exponent field),
polarity of a nonzero value or exponent can be toggled by positioning the cursor on the polarity sign
and turning the navigation wheel. Polarity is also toggled when using the navigation wheel to
decrease or increase the value or exponent past zero. A zero (0) value or exponent (for example,
+00) is always positive and cannot be toggled to negative polarity.
After executing this command and pressing the EXIT (LOCAL) key, the function returns nil.
Example
display.clear()
display.settext("Enter value between$N -0.10 and 2.00:
value = display.inputvalue("+0.00", 0.5, -0.1, 2.0)
print("Value entered = ", value)

code
memory

The code that is run from the USER menu
Determines if code is saved to nonvolatile memory:

▪
▪

0 or display.DONT_SAVE: Does not save the code to nonvolatile memory
1 or display.SAVE: Saves the code to nonvolatile memory (default)

Details
After adding code to the load menu, you can run it from the front panel by pressing the LOAD key,
then selecting USER to select from the available code to load. Pressing the RUN key then runs
the script.
You can add items in any order. They are always displayed in alphabetical order when the menu
is selected.
Any Lua code can be included in the code parameter. If memory is set to display.SAVE, the entry
(name and code) is saved in nonvolatile memory. Scripts, functions, and variables used in the code
are not saved by display.SAVE. Functions and variables need to be saved with the code. If the
code is not saved in nonvolatile memory, it is lost when the 2600B is turned off. See Example 2
below.
If you do not make a selection for memory, the code is automatically saved to nonvolatile memory.

You can create a script that defines several functions, and then use the display.loadmenu.add()
command to add items that call those individual functions. This allows the operator to run tests from
the front panel.
Example 1
display.loadmenu.add("Test9", "Test9()")
Assume a user script named Test9 is loaded into the runtime environment. Adds the menu entry to the USER
menu to run the script after loading.

Example 2
display.loadmenu.add("Test", "DUT1() beeper.beep(2, 500)", display.SAVE)
Assume a script with a function named “DUT1” is loaded into the instrument, and the script has not been saved
in nonvolatile memory.
Now assume you want to add a test named “Test” to the USER menu. You want the test to run the function
named DUT1 and sound the beeper. This example adds Test to the menu, defines the code, and then saves
the displayName and code in nonvolatile memory.
When Test is run from the front panel USER menu, the function named DUT1 executes and the beeper beeps
for two seconds.
Now assume you turn off instrument power. Because the script was not saved in nonvolatile memory, the
function named DUT1 is lost when you turn the instrument on. When Test is run again from the front panel, an
error is generated because DUT1 no longer exists in the instrument as a function.

Example 3
display.loadmenu.add("Part1", "testpart([[Part1]], 5.0)", display.SAVE)
Adds an entry called Part1 to the front-panel USER load menu for the code testpart([[Part1]], 5.0)
and saves it in nonvolatile memory.

After sending this command, script execution pauses for the operator to select a menu item. An item
is selected by rotating the navigation wheel to place the blinking cursor on the item, and then pressing
the navigation wheel (or the ENTER key). When an item is selected, the text of that selection is
returned.
Pressing the EXIT (LOCAL) key does not abort the script while the menu is displayed, but it does
return nil. The script can be aborted by calling the exit function when nil is returned.
Example

This function creates an editable input field at the present cursor position, and an input prompt
message on the bottom line. Example of a displayed input field and prompt:
0.00V
Input 0 to +2V
The format parameter uses zeros (0), the decimal point, polarity sign, and exponents to define how
the input field is formatted.
The format parameter can include the options shown in the following table.
Option

Description
E

+

0
.

Include the E to display the value exponentially. Include a
plus sign (+) for positive/negative exponent entry. Do not
include the plus sign (+) to prevent negative value entry. 0
defines the digit positions for the exponent.
Allows operators to enter positive or negative values. If the
plus sign (+) is not included, the operator cannot enter a
negative value.
Defines the digit positions for the value. You can use up to six
zeros (0).
The decimal point where needed for the value.

Examples
0.00000E+0

+0.00

+00.0000E+00
+0.00

You can use the minimum and maximum parameters to limit the values that can be entered. When a
plus sign (+) is not selected for format, the minimum limit must be greater than or equal to zero (0).
When limits are used, the operator cannot enter values above or below these limits.
The input value is limited to ±1e37.
After sending this command, script execution pauses for the operator to enter a value and press
ENTER.
For positive and negative entry (plus sign (+) used for the value field and the exponent field), polarity
of a nonzero value or exponent can be toggled by positioning the cursor on the polarity sign and
turning the navigation wheel. Polarity also toggles when using the navigation wheel to decrease or
increase the value or exponent past zero. A zero value or exponent (for example, +00) is always
positive and cannot be toggled to negative polarity.
After executing this command and pressing the EXIT (LOCAL) key, the value returns nil.
Example
value = display.prompt("0.00", "V", "Input 0 to +2V", 0.5, 0, 2)
print(value)
The above command prompts the operator to enter a voltage value. The valid input range is 0 to +2.00, with a
default of 0.50:
0.50V
Input 0 to +2V
If the operator enters 0.70, the output is:
7.00000e-01

row
column
style

The row number for the cursor (1 or 2)
The active column position to set; row 1 has columns 1 to 20, row 2 has columns 1 to
32
Set the cursor to invisible (0, default) or blinking (1)

Details
Sending this command selects the user screen and then moves the cursor to the given location.
The display.clear(), display.setcursor(), and display.settext() functions are
overlapped commands. That is, the script does not wait for one of these commands to complete.
These functions do not immediately update the display. For performance considerations, they update
the display as soon as processing time becomes available.
An out-of-range parameter for row sets the cursor to row 2. An out-of-range parameter for column
sets the cursor to column 20 for row 1, or 32 for row 2.
An out-of-range parameter for style sets it to 0 (invisible).
A blinking cursor is only visible when it is positioned over displayed text. It cannot be seen when
positioned over a space character.
Example
display.clear()
display.setcursor(1, 8)
display.settext("Hello")
display.setcursor(2, 14)
display.settext("World")
This example displays a message on the front panel, approximately center. Note that the top line of text is
larger than the bottom line of text.
The front panel of the instrument displays Hello on the top line and World on the second line.

Details
This function selects the user display screen and displays the given text.
After the instrument is turned on, the first time you use a display command to write to the display, the
message "User Screen" is cleared. After the first write, you need to use display.clear() to clear
the message.
The display.clear(), display.setcursor(), and display.settext() functions are
overlapped commands. That is, the script does not wait for one of these commands to complete.
These functions do not immediately update the display. For performance considerations, they update
the display as soon as processing time becomes available.
The text starts at the present cursor position. After the text is displayed, the cursor is after the last
character in the display message.
Top line text does not wrap to the bottom line of the display automatically. Any text that does not fit on
the current line is truncated. If the text is truncated, the cursor remains at the end of the line.
The text remains on the display until replaced or cleared.
The character codes described in the following table can also be included in the text string.

Details
After you send this function, script execution pauses until a front-panel action (for example, pressing
a key or the navigation wheel, or turning the navigation wheel). After the action, the value of the key
(or action) is returned.
If the EXIT (LOCAL) key is pressed while this function is waiting for a front-panel action, the script is
not aborted.
A typical use for this function is to prompt the user to press the EXIT (LOCAL) key to abort the script
or press any other key to continue. For example, if the keyCode value 75 is returned (the EXIT
(LOCAL) key was pressed), you can call the exit() function to abort the script.

operating in an error condition. If the condition is corrected, the
instrument returns to normal operation.
There is a condition that cannot be corrected that prevents the
instrument from functioning properly. Disconnect the DUT and turn the
power off and then on again. If the error is a hardware fault that
persists after cycling the power, the instrument must be repaired.

In an expanded system, each TSP-Link enabled instrument is assigned a node number. The variable
errorNode stores the node number where the error originated. The errorNode is always 1 on the
2604B/2614B/2634B.

status

The enable status of the event log:
1 or eventlog.ENABLE: Event log enable
0 or eventlog.DISABLE: Event log disable

Details
When the event log is disabled (eventlog.DISABLE or 0), no new events are added to the event
log. You can, however, read and remove existing events.
When the event log is enabled, new events are logged.
Example
print(eventlog.enable)
eventlog.enable = eventlog.DISABLE
print(eventlog.enable)
Displays the present status of the 2600B event log.

Usage
fileVar:flush()
fileVar

The file descriptor variable to flush

Details
The fileVar:write() or io.write() functions buffer data, which may not be written immediately
to the USB flash drive. Use fileVar:flush() to flush this data. Using this function removes the
need to close a file after writing to it, allowing the file to be left open to write more data. Data may be
lost if the file is not closed or flushed before a script ends.
If there is going to be a time delay before more data is written to a file, and you want to keep the file
open, flush the file after you write to it to prevent loss of data.

precision

A number representing the number of digits to be printed for numbers printed with
the print(), printbuffer(), and printnumber() functions; must be a number
between 1 and 16

Details
This attribute specifies the precision (number of digits) for numeric data printed with the print(),
printbuffer(), and printnumber() functions. The format.asciiprecision attribute is only
used with the ASCII format. The precision value must be a number from 0 to 16.
Note that the precision is the number of significant digits printed. There is always one digit to the left
of the decimal point; be sure to include this digit when setting the precision.
Example
format.asciiprecision = 10
x = 2.54
printnumber(x)
format.asciiprecision = 3
printnumber(x)

Byte order value as follows:

▪
▪

Most significant byte first: 0, format.NORMAL, format.NETWORK, or
format.BIGENDIAN
Least significant byte first: 1, format.SWAPPED or format.LITTLEENDIAN

Details
This attribute selects the byte order in which data is written when you are printing data values with the
printnumber() and printbuffer() functions. The byte order attribute is only used with the
format.SREAL, format.REAL, format.REAL32, and format.REAL64 data formats.
format.NORMAL, format.BIGENDIAN, and format.NETWORK select the same byte order.
format.SWAPPED and format.LITTLEENDIAN select the same byte order. Selecting which to use
is a matter of preference.
Select the format.SWAPPED or format.LITTLEENDIAN byte order when sending data to a
computer with a Microsoft Windows operating system.
Example
x = 1.23
format.data = format.REAL32
format.byteorder = format.LITTLEENDIAN
printnumber(x)
format.byteorder = format.BIGENDIAN
printnumber(x)

The output depends on the terminal program
you use, but it looks something like:

▪

ASCII format: 1 or format.ASCII
Single-precision IEEE Std 754 binary format: 2, format.SREAL, or
format.REAL32
Double-precision IEEE Std 754 binary format: 3, format.REAL,
format.REAL64, or format.DREAL

Details
The precision of numeric values can be controlled with the format.asciiprecision attribute. The
byte order of format.SREAL, format.REAL, format.REAL32, and format.REAL64 can be
selected with the format.byteorder attribute.
REAL32 and SREAL select the same single precision format. REAL and REAL64 select the same
double-precision format. They are alternative identifiers. Selecting which to use is a matter of
preference.
The IEEE Std 754 binary formats use four bytes for single-precision values and eight bytes for
double-precision values.
When data is written with any of the binary formats, the response message starts with #0 and ends
with a new line. When data is written with the ASCII format, elements are separated with a comma
and space.

Binary formats are not intended to be interpreted by humans.
Example
format.asciiprecision = 10
x = 3.14159265
format.data = format.ASCII
printnumber(x)
format.data = format.REAL64
printnumber(x)

Output a number represented by x in ASCII
using a precision of 10, then output the same
number in binary using double-precision
format.
Output:
3.141592650e+00

Usage
address = gpib.address

address

The GPIB address of the instrument (1 to 30)

Details
The address can be set to any address value from 1 to 30. However, the address must be unique in
the system. It cannot conflict with an address that is assigned to another instrument or to the GPIB
controller.
A new GPIB address takes effect when the command to change it is processed. If there are response
messages in the output queue when this command is processed, they must be read at the new
address.
If command messages are being queued (sent before this command has executed), the new settings
may take effect in the middle of a subsequent command message, so use care when setting this
attribute from the GPIB interface.
You should allow sufficient time for the command to be processed before attempting to communicate
with the instrument again.
The reset() function does not affect the GPIB address.
Example
gpib.address = 26
address = gpib.address
print(address)
Sets the GPIB address and reads the address.

Type

TSP-Link accessible

Function

No

Affected by

Where saved

Default value

Usage
imeas = i_leakage_measure(smuX, levelv, limiti, sourcedelay, measurei, measuredelay)
imeas
X

The measured current
Instrument channel (for example, smua refers to SMU channel A)

levelv
limiti
sourcedelay
measurei

Voltage level to step to when this function is called
Current limit setting for the voltage step
Delay to wait before lowering the current limit for measurement
Current limit (and measure range); the current limit is lower at this level and because
high-capacitance mode is active, the measure range follows
Delay to wait after lowering the current limit before making the measurement

measuredelay

Details
This function causes the SMU to:

•

Change its current limit to limiti with a voltage output of levelv for sourcedelay time, and
then change its current limit to measurei (that also changes the measurement range to
measurei) for measuredelay time

•

When measuredelay time expires, a measurement is made and returned as imeas

When measuring leakage current:

•

Charge the capacitor before calling this function (the output of the instrument is usually at a
nonzero voltage before calling this function; when measuring leakage, this function does not
charge the capacitor)

•

Set levelv = 0

Example
smua.source.highc = smua.ENABLE
smua.source.levelv = 5
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_ON
delay(1)
imeas = i_leakage_measure(smua, 0, 1, 300e-3, 10e-6, 0.1)
Enable high-capacitance mode. Charge the capacitor at 5 V for 1 second set by delay(1).
The parameters passed on to the i_leakage_measure() function in this example are:
smu = smua
levelv = 0 V
limiti = 1 A
sourcedelay = 300 ms
measurei = 10 µA range
measuredelay = 100 ms
The levels and delays depend on the value and type of capacitor used.

Details
This function causes the SMU to:

•

Change its current limit to limiti with a voltage output of levelv for sourcedelay time, and
then changes its current limit to measurei (that also changes the measurement range to
measurei) for measuredelay time.

•

When measuredelay time expires, measurements are made at a rate determined by the
smuX.measure.nplc setting.

When testing the leakage current threshold:

•

Charge the capacitor before calling this function. The output of the instrument is usually at a
non-zero voltage before calling this function; when measuring leakage, this function does not
charge the capacitor.

msg

Numeric identifier of the first pulse configuration to be initiated
Numeric identifier of the second pulse configuration to be initiated

Details
The pulse trains associated with the indicated tags are generated simultaneously. This is useful when
testing devices such as voltage regulators, where the input signal and output load must be applied to
the instrument at the same time.
When using this function, each tag1 pulse encapsulates each tag2 pulse in time. Specifically, the
tag1 pulse transitions from its bias level to its pulse level before the tag2 pulse. Both the tag1 and
tag2 pulses return to their respective bias levels at approximately the same time. Measurements for
both pulse trains occur at the same time (see the waveform in the figure below).
To provide this encapsulation, the following rules are enforced:
▪

The tag1 pulse on time, ton1, must be configured to be > 40 μs longer than the tag2 pulse
on time.

▪

The tag1 and tag2 pulse off times, toff, must be the same.

Details
You must use the io.flush() or io.close() functions to write data to the file system.

Data is not automatically written to a file when you use the io.write() function. The io.write()
function buffers data; it may not be written to the USB flash drive immediately. Use the io.flush()
function to immediately write buffered data to the drive.
This function only flushes the default output file.
Using this command removes the need to close a file after writing to it and allows it to be left open to
write more data. Data may be lost if the file is not closed or flushed before an application ends. To
prevent the loss of data if there is going to be a time delay before more data is written (and when you
want to keep the file open and not close it), flush the file after writing to it.

Function

Yes

Affected by

Where saved

Default value

Usage
lan.applysettings()

Details
Disconnects all existing LAN connections to the instrument and re-initializes the LAN with the present
configuration settings.
This function initiates a background operation. LAN configuration could be a lengthy operation.
Although the function returns immediately, the LAN initialization continues to run in the background.
Even though the LAN configuration settings may not have changed since the LAN was last
connected, new settings may take effect due to the dynamic nature of dynamic host configuration
protocol (DHCP) or dynamic link local addressing (DLLA) configuration.
Re-initialization takes effect even if the configuration has not changed since the last time the
instrument connected to the LAN.
Example
lan.applysettings()
Re-initialize the LAN interface with new settings.

DNS server IP address
Entry index (1 or 2)

Details
This attribute is an array of Domain Name System (DNS) server addresses. These addresses take
priority for DNS lookups and are consulted before any server addresses that are obtained using
DHCP. This allows local DNS servers to be specified that take priority over DHCP-configured global
DNS servers.
You can specify up to two addresses. The address specified by 1 is consulted first for DNS lookups.
dnsAddress must be a string specifying the IP address of the DNS server in dotted decimal
notation.
Unused entries are returned as "0.0.0.0" when read. To disable an entry, set its value to
"0.0.0.0" or the empty string "".
Although only two addresses may be manually specified here, the instrument uses up to three DNS
server addresses. If two are specified here, only one that is given by a DHCP server is used. If no
entries are specified here, up to three addresses that are given by a DHCP server are used.
Example
dnsaddress = "164.109.48.173"
lan.config.dns.address[1] = dnsaddress
Set the DNS address 1 to 164.109.48.173.

Section 9: TSP command reference

Details
This attribute holds the host name to request during dynamic DNS registration. Dynamic DNS
registration works with DHCP to register the host name specified in this attribute with the DNS server.
The factory default value for hostName is "k-<model number>-<serial number>", where
<model number> and <serial number> are replaced with the actual model number and serial
number of the instrument (for example, "k-2602B-1234567"). Note that hyphens separate the
characters of hostName.
The length of the fully qualified host name (combined length of the domain and host name with
separator characters) must be less than or equal to 255 characters. Although up to 63 characters can
be entered here, you must make sure the combined length is no more than 255 characters.
Setting this attribute to an empty string (in other words, setting this attribute to a string of length zero
or a string that consists entirely of whitespace characters) reverts the host name to the factory
default value.
Example
print(lan.config.dns.hostname)
Outputs the present dynamic DNS host name.

timeout

The LAN timed-wait state interval in seconds

Details
This attribute controls the amount of time that resources are allocated to closed TCP connections.
When a TCP connection is closed, the connection is put in a timed-wait state and resources remain
allocated for the connection until the timed-wait state ends. During the timed-wait interval, the
instrument processes delayed packets that arrive after the connection is closed.
Use this attribute to tailor the timed-wait state interval for the instrument.

This attribute controls if and where remote access passwords are required. Set this attribute to one of
the values below to enable password checking:

•

localnode.PASSWORD_NONE or 0: Disable passwords everywhere

•

localnode.PASSWORD_WEB or 1: Use passwords on the web interface only

•

localnode.PASSWORD_LAN or 2: Use passwords on the web interface and all LAN interfaces

•

localnode.PASSWORD_ALL or 3: Use passwords on the web interface and all remote
command interfaces

When a password is set for the web interface, you cannot make changes using the web interface
options Virtual Front Panel, Flash Upgrade, or TSB Embedded.
When using this command from a remote node, replace localnode with the node reference, for
example node[5].passwordmode.
If you enable password mode, you must also assign a password.
Example
mode = localnode.PASSWORD_WEB
localnode.passwordmode = mode
localnode.password = "SMU1234"

Sets value of mode to PASSWORD_WEB.
Allows use of passwords on the web interface only.
Set the password to SMU1234.

prompting

Prompting mode:

▪
▪

Do not generate prompts: 1
Generate prompts: 0

Details
When the prompting mode is enabled, the instrument generates prompts when the instrument is
ready to take another command. Because the prompt is not generated until the previous command
completes, enabling prompts provides handshaking with the instrument to prevent buffer overruns.
When prompting is enabled, the instrument might generate the following prompts:

•

TSP>. The standard prompt, which indicates that the previous command completed normally.

•

TSP?. The prompt that is issued if there are unread entries in the error queue when the prompt is
issued. Like the TSP> prompt, it indicates that processing of the command is complete. It does
not mean the previous command generated an error, only that there were still errors in the queue
when the command processing was complete.

•

>>>>. The continuation prompt, which occurs when downloading scripts. When downloading
scripts, many command messages must be sent as a group. The continuation prompt indicates
that the instrument is expecting more messages as part of the present command.

Commands do not generate prompts. The instrument generates prompts in response to command
completion.
Prompts are enabled or disabled only for the remote interface that is active when you send the
command. For example, if you enable prompts when the LAN connection is active, they are not
enabled for a subsequent USB connection.

Do not disable prompting when using Test Script Builder. Test Script Builder requires prompts and
sets the prompting mode automatically. If you disable prompting, the instrument stops responding
when you communicate using Test Script Builder because it is waiting for a common complete
prompt from Test Script Builder.

Details
When this attribute is enabled, the IEEE Std 488.2 common commands generate prompts if
prompting is enabled with the localnode.prompts attribute. If localnode.prompts4882 is
enabled, limit the number of *trg commands sent to a running script to 50 regardless of the setting
of the localnode.prompts attribute.
When this attribute is disabled, IEEE Std 488.2 common commands do not generate prompts. When
using the *trg command with a script that executes trigger.wait() repeatedly, disable
prompting to avoid problems associated with the command interface input queue filling.

Details
If you want to reset a specific instrument or a subordinate node, use the node[X].reset()
command.
A local node reset includes:

•

Source-measure unit (SMU) attributes affected by a SMU reset are reset

•

Other settings are restored back to factory default settings

A localnode.reset() is different than a reset() because reset() resets the entire system.
When using this command from a remote node, localnode should be replaced with the node
reference, for example node[5].reset().

...

Details
If startIndex ≤ 1, 1 is used as startIndex. If n < endIndex, n is used as endIndex.
When any given reading buffers are used in overlapped commands that have not yet completed (at
least to the specified index), this function outputs data as it becomes available.
When there are outstanding overlapped commands to acquire data, n refers to the index that the last
entry in the table has after all the measurements have completed.
If you pass a reading buffer instead of a reading buffer subtable, the default subtable for that reading
buffer is used.
This command generates a single response message that contains all data. The response message
is stored in the output queue.
The format.data attribute controls the format of the response message.
Example
format.data = format.ASCII
format.asciiprecision = 6
printbuffer(1, rb1.n, rb1)
This assumes that rb1 is a valid reading buffer in the runtime environment. The use of rb1.n
(bufferVar.n) indicates that the instrument should output all readings in the reading buffer. In this example,
rb1.n equals 10.
Example of output data (rb1.readings):

What to reset:

▪
▪

true: If the node is the master, the entire system is reset (default)
false: Only the local group is reset

Details
The reset() command in its simplest form resets the entire TSP-enabled system, including the
controlling node and all subordinate nodes.
If you want to reset a specific instrument, use either the localnode.reset() or
node[X].reset() command. Use the localnode.reset() command for the local instrument.
Use the node[X].reset() command to reset an instrument on a subordinate node.
You can only reset the entire system using reset(true) if the node is the master. If the node is not
the master node, executing this command generates an error.
Example
reset(true)
If the node is the master node, the entire system is reset; if the node is not the master node, an error is
generated.

scriptVar

The created script; this is nil if an error is encountered

file
name

The path and file name of the script file to load
The name of the script to be created

Details
The file path may be absolute or relative to the current working directory. The root folder of the USB
flash drive has the absolute path "/usb1/". Both the forward slash (/) and backslash (\) are
supported as directory separators.
The file to be loaded must start with the loadscript or loadandrunscript keywords, contain the
body of the script, and end with the endscript keyword.
Script naming:

•

If the name parameter is an empty string, or name is absent (or nil) and the script name cannot
be extracted from the file, scriptVar is the only handle to the created script.

•
•

If name is given (and not nil), any script name embedded in the file is ignored.

•

If name is absent or nil, the command attempts to extract the name of the script from the file.
Any conflict between the extracted name and that of an existing script in the scripts table
generates an error. If the script name cannot be extracted, the created script's name attribute is
initialized to the empty string and must be set to a valid nonempty string before saving the script
to nonvolatile memory.

If name conflicts with the name of an existing script in the script.user.scripts table, the
existing script’s name attribute is set to an empty string before it is replaced in the
script.user.scripts table by the new script.

Example
myTest8 =
script.load("/usb1/filename.tsp",
"myTest8")

Loads the script myTest8 from the USB
flash drive.

Details
Autorun scripts run automatically when the instrument is turned on. You can set any number of scripts
to autorun.
The run order for autorun scripts is arbitrary, so make sure the run order is not important.
The default value for scriptVar.autorun depends on how the script was loaded. The default is no
if the script was loaded with loadscript or script.new(). It is yes for scripts loaded with
loadandrunscript or script.newautorun().

Make sure to save the script in nonvolatile memory after setting the autorun attribute so that the
instrument keeps the setting.

Name of the variable that references the script
A string that represents the name of the script

Details
When setting the script name, this attribute renames the script that the variable scriptVar
references.
This attribute must be either a valid Lua identifier or the empty string. Changing the name of a script
changes the index that is used to access the script in the script.user.scripts table. Setting the
attribute to an empty string removes the script from the table completely, and the script becomes an
unnamed script.
As long as there are variables referencing an unnamed script, the script can be accessed through
those variables. When all variables that reference an unnamed script are removed, the script is
removed from the runtime environment.
If the new name is the same as a name that is already used for another script, the name of the other
script is set to an empty string, and that script becomes unnamed.

Changing the name of a script does not change the name of any variables that reference that script.
The variables still reference the script, but the names of the script and variables may not match.

Yes

Affected by

Where saved

Default value

Usage
data = serial.read(maxchars)
data
maxchars

A string that consists of all data read from the serial port
An integer that specifies the maximum number of characters to read

Details
This function reads available characters from the serial port. It does not wait for new characters to
arrive. As long as maxchars is less than 200 characters, all characters that are received by the serial
port (before the serial.read() command is executed) are returned. If too many characters are
received between calls to this function, the RS-232 buffers overflow and some characters may
be lost.
Call this function as many times as necessary to receive the required number of characters. For
optimal performance, use a small delay between repeated calls to this function.
The data returned is the raw data stream read from the port. No characters, such as control
characters or terminator characters, are interpreted.
If you attempt to use this function when the serial port is enabled as a command interface, a settings
conflict error is generated.
Example
data = serial.read(200)
print(data)

Read data from the serial port.
Output:
John Doe
The above output indicates that the string "John Doe" was read
from the serial port.

No

Affected by

Where saved

Default value

Usage
settimezone(offset)
settimezone("offset", "dstOffset", "dstStart", "dstEnd")
offset
dstOffset
dstStart
dstEnd

String representing offset from UTC
String representing the daylight savings offset from UTC
String representing when daylight savings time starts
String representing when daylight savings time ends

Details
You only need to set the time zone if you use the os.time() and os.date() functions.
If only one parameter is given, the same time offset is used throughout the year. If four parameters
are given, time is adjusted twice during the year for daylight savings time.
offset and dstOffset are strings of the form "[+|-]hh[:mm[:ss]]" that indicate how much
time must be added to the local time to get UTC time:

•

hh is a number between 0 and 23 that represents hours

•

mm is a number between 0 and 59 that represents minutes

•

ss is a number between 0 and 59 that represents seconds

The minute, second, +, and − fields are optional.
For example, to set the UTC-5 time zone, you specify the string "5", because UTC-5 is 5 hours
behind UTC and you must add 5 hours to the local time to determine UTC time. To specify the time
zone UTC4, you specify "-4", because UTC4 is 4 hours ahead of UTC and 4 hours must be
subtracted from the local time to determine UTC.
dstStart and dstEnd are strings of the form "MM.w.dw/hh[:mm[:ss]]" that indicate when
daylight savings time begins and ends respectively:

•

MM is a number between 1 and 12 that represents the month

•

w is a number between 1 and 5 that represents the week in the month

•

dw is a number between 0 and 6 that represents the day of the week (where 0 is Sunday)

The rest of the fields represent the time of day that the change takes effect:

•

hh represents hours

•

mm represents minutes

•

ss represents seconds

The minutes and seconds fields are optional.
The week of the month and day of the week fields are not specific dates.

▪
▪
▪

Factory default setup: 0
User-saved setup in nonvolatile memory: 1 to 5
User-saved setup on a USB flash drive: "/path/filename"

Details
When the id parameter is an integer (n), it is interpreted as the setup number to restore from the
instrument's nonvolatile memory. When n = 0, the instrument recalls the factory default setup; when
n = 1 to 5, the instrument recalls a user-saved setup.
When the id parameter is a string, it is interpreted as the path and file name of the setup to restore
from a file on a USB flash drive. The path may be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
Before a setup is recalled, an instrument reset is performed.
Example 1
setup.recall(1)

Recall the user-saved setup at location 1.

setup.recall("/usb1/KEITHLEY_30730.set")

Recall a user-saved setup stored in a file
named KEITHLEY_30730 on a USB

This attribute does not affect the smuX.measure.calibrateY() command. The polarity for
smuX.measure.calibrateY() is dictated by the range parameter that is defined for it. The
measurement calibration commands require the measurements provided to have been made using
the polarity being calibrated.
When making measurements for calibration points far away from zero, the desired polarity constants
are inherently used. However, when making measurements near zero, it is possible that the
instrument could use the calibration constants from the wrong polarity. Setting smuX.cal.polarity
to positive or negative forces measurements to be made using the calibration constants for a given
polarity, rather than basing the choice on the raw measurement data.
This attribute can only be set to positive or negative when calibration is unlocked. This attribute is
automatically set to smuX.CAL_AUTO when calibration is locked.

2 or smuX.AUTOZERO_AUTO: Automatic checking of reference and zero
measurements; an autozero is performed when needed
Source-measure unit (SMU) channel (for example, smua.measure.autozero
applies to SMU channel A)

Details
The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) uses a ratiometric A/D conversion technique. To ensure the
accuracy of readings, the instrument must periodically obtain new measurements of its internal
ground and voltage reference. The time interval between updates to these reference measurements
is determined by the integration aperture being used for measurements. The 2600B uses separate
reference and zero measurements for each aperture.
By default, the instrument automatically checks these reference measurements whenever a signal
measurement is made. If the reference measurements have expired when a signal measurement is
made, the instrument automatically takes two more A/D conversions, one for the reference and one
for the zero, before returning the result. Thus, occasionally, a measurement takes more time than
normal.
This additional time can cause problems in sweeps and other test sequences in which measurement
timing is critical. To avoid the time that is needed for the reference measurements in these situations,
you can use the smuX.measure.autozero attribute to disable the automatic reference
measurements.
Disabling automatic reference measurements may allow the instrument to gradually drift out of
specification. To minimize the drift, make a reference and zero measurement immediately before any
critical test sequences. You can use the smuX.AUTOZERO_ONCE setting to force a refresh of the
reference and zero measurements that are used for the present aperture setting.
The 2600B stores the reference measurements for the last ten NPLC settings that were used in a
reference cache. If an NPLC setting is selected and an entry for it is not in the cache, the oldest (least
recently used) entry is discarded to make room for the new entry.
Example
smua.measure.autozero = smua.AUTOZERO_ONCE
Performs autozero once for SMU channel A.

This function generates and activates new calibration constants for the given range.
The positive and negative polarities of the instrument must be adjusted separately. Use a positive
value for the range parameter to adjust the positive polarity and a negative value for the range
parameter to adjust the negative polarity.
All four measurements (cp1Measured, cp1Reference, cp2Measured, and cp2Reference) must
be made with the calibration set that is active. Corruption of the calibration constants may result if this
is ignored.
The new calibration constants are activated immediately but they are not written to nonvolatile
memory. Use the smuX.cal.save() function to save the new constants to nonvolatile memory. The
active calibration constants stay in effect until the instrument is power cycled or a calibration set is
loaded from nonvolatile memory with the smuX.cal.restore() function.
This function is only available when calibration is unlocked using smuX.cal.unlock().

Details
This attribute allows for additional delay (settling time) before making a measurement. If you define
the value instead of using the automatic delay value, the delay you set is used regardless of the
range.
The smuX.DELAY_AUTO setting causes a current range-dependent delay to be inserted when a
current measurement is requested. This happens when a current measurement command is
executed, when the measure action is being performed in a sweep, or after changing ranges during
an autoranged measurement.
If smuX.measure.count is greater than 1, the measurement delay is only inserted before the first
measurement.

SMU channel (for example, smua.measure.filter.type applies to SMU

Details
The 2600B provides a moving average, repeating average, and median filter type.
For the repeating filter, the stack (filter count) is filled, and the conversions are averaged to yield a
reading. The stack is then cleared, and the process starts over.
The moving average filter uses a first-in, first-out stack. When the stack (filter count) becomes full, the
measurement conversions are averaged, yielding a reading. For each subsequent conversion placed
into the stack, the oldest conversion is discarded. The stack is re-averaged, yielding a new reading.
The median filter uses a first-in, first-out stack. When the stack (filter count) becomes full, the reading
nearest to the middle is returned. For each subsequent conversion placed into the stack, the oldest
reading is discarded. The stack is then re-sorted, yielding a new reading. If the filter count is an even
number, the reading returned is the average of the two middle readings.
Example
smua.measure.filter.count = 10
smua.measure.filter.type = smua.FILTER_MOVING_AVG
smua.measure.filter.enable = smua.FILTER_ON

Details
This attribute sets the time interval between measurements when smuX.measure.count is set to a
value greater than 1. The SMU attempts to start each measurement when scheduled. If the SMU
cannot keep up with the interval setting, measurements are made as quickly as possible.
If filtered measurements are being made, the time interval is from the start of the first measurement
for the filtered reading to the first measurement for a subsequent filtered reading. Extra
measurements made to satisfy a filtered reading are not paced by this interval.

A reading buffer object where the readings are stored
A reading buffer object where current readings are stored

Details
This function starts a measurement and returns immediately. The measurements, as they are
performed, are stored in a reading buffer (along with any other information that is being acquired). If
the instrument is configured to return multiple readings where one is requested, the readings are
available as they are made. Measurements are in the following units of measure: v = volts, i =
amperes, r = ohms, p = watts.
The second form of this function, smuX.measure.overlappediv(), stores current readings in
ibuffer and voltage readings in vbuffer.
This function is an overlapped command. Script execution continues while the measurements are
made in the background. Attempts to access result values that have not yet been generated cause
the script to block and wait for the data to become available. The waitcomplete() function can
also be used to wait for the measurements to complete before continuing.
If a given reading buffer contains any data, it is cleared before making any measurements, unless the
reading buffer has been configured to append data.

SMU measurement function (v = voltage, i = current)

Details
Reading this attribute returns the positive full-scale value of the measurement range that the SMU is
currently using. Assigning a value to this attribute sets the SMU on a fixed range large enough to
measure the assigned value. The instrument selects the best range for measuring a value of
rangeValue.
This attribute is primarily intended to eliminate the time that is required by the automatic range
selection performed by a measuring instrument. Because selecting a fixed range prevents
autoranging, an overrange condition can occur. For example, measuring 10.0 V on the 2601B,
2602B, or 2604B 6 V range or measuring 5.0 V on the 2611B, 2612B, or 2614B 2 V range causes an
overrange. The value 9.91000E+37 is returned when this occurs.
If the source function is the same as the measurement function (for example, sourcing voltage and
measuring voltage), the measurement range is locked to be the same as the source range. However,
the setting for the measure range is retained. If the source function is changed (for example, from
sourcing voltage to sourcing current), the retained measurement range is used.
2601B, 2602B, or 2604B example: Assume the source function is voltage. The source range is 1 V
and you set the measure range for 6 V. Since the source range is 1 V, the SMU performs voltage
measurements on the 1 V range. If you now change the source function to current, voltage
measurements are made on the 6 V range.
Explicitly setting a measure range disables measure autoranging for that function. Autoranging is
controlled separately for each source and measurement function: source voltage, source current,
measure voltage and measure current. Autoranging is enabled for all four by default.
Changing the range while the output is off does not update the hardware settings, but querying
returns the range setting that is used when the output is turned on. Setting a range while the output is
on takes effect immediately.
With measure autoranging enabled, the range is changed only when a measurement is made.
Querying the range after a measurement returns the range selected for that measurement.

measurement as iReading and vReading, respectively. Additionally, it can store current and
voltage readings if buffers are provided (iReadingBuffer and vReadingBuffer ).
The smuX.measure.count attribute determines how many measurements are performed. When
using a reading buffer, it also determines the number of readings to store in the buffer. If a reading
buffer is not specified, the SMU ignores the smuX.measure.count attribute and only makes one
measurement.
The readingBuffer is cleared before making any measurements unless the buffer is configured to
append data.

Details
The smuX.measureYandstep() function makes a measurement and then sets the source to
sourceValue. Usage of the smuX.measureivandstep() function is similar, but makes two
measurements simultaneously, one for current (i) and one for voltage (v).
Measurements are in the following units of measure: v = volts, i = amperes, r = ohms, p = watts.
Make sure the specified source value is appropriate for the selected source function. For example, if
the source voltage function is selected, then sourceValue is expected to be a new voltage level.
Both source and measure autorange must be disabled before using this function. This function cannot
be used if source high capacitance mode is enabled (high capacitance mode requires autoranging to
be enabled).
This function is provided for very fast execution of source-measure loops. The measurement is made
before the source is stepped. Before using this function, and before any loop this function may be
used in, set the source value to its initial level.

All routines that return measurements can also store them in either reading buffer. Overlapped
measurements are always stored in a reading buffer. Synchronous measurements return either a
single-point measurement or can be stored in a reading buffer if passed to the measurement

Details
This attribute indicates the source autorange state. Its value is smuX.AUTORANGE_OFF when the
SMU source circuit is on a fixed range and smuX.AUTORANGE_ON when it is in autorange mode.
Setting this attribute to smuX.AUTORANGE_OFF puts the SMU on a fixed source range. The fixed
range used is the present SMU source circuit range.
Setting this attribute to smuX.AUTORANGE_ON puts the SMU source circuit into autorange mode. If
the source output is on, the SMU immediately changes range to the range most appropriate for the
value being sourced if that range is different than the present SMU range.
Autorange is disabled if the source level is edited from the front panel. Setting the source range also
turns off autorange when set by using the smuX.source.rangeY attribute.
Resetting the instrument selects the smuX.AUTORANGE_ON.
Example
smua.source.autorangev = smua.AUTORANGE_ON

Enables volts source autorange for SMU

Details
This function generates and activates new calibration constants for the given range.
The positive and negative polarities of the source must be adjusted separately. Use a positive value
for range to adjust the positive polarity and a negative value for range to adjust the negative polarity.
Do not use 0.0 for a negative point; 0.0 is considered to be a positive number.
Typically, the two points that are used are near zero for point 1 and 90% of full scale for point 2. Full
scale for point 2 should be avoided if the source of the SMU is substantially out of calibration.
The two reference measurements must be made with the source using the active calibration set. For
example, source a value, measure it, and do not change the active calibration set before issuing
this command.
The new calibration constants are activated immediately but they are not written to nonvolatile
memory. Use the smuX.cal.save() function to save the new constants to nonvolatile memory. The
active calibration constants stay in effect until the instrument is power cycled or a calibration set is
loaded from nonvolatile memory with the smuX.cal.restore() function.
This function is only available when calibration is unlocked using smuX.cal.unlock().
Example
smua.source.calibratev(1, 1e-10, 1e-5, 0.9, 0.903)
Generates and activates new source calibration constants for the 1 A range. For point 1, it uses 1e−10 as the
source value and 1e−5 as the reference measurement. For point 2, it uses 0.9 for the source value and 0.903
for the reference measurement.

Details
Use the smuX.source.limiti attribute to limit the current output of the voltage source. Use
smuX.source.limitv to limit the voltage output of the current source. The SMU always uses
autoranging for the limit setting. Use the smuX.source.limitp attribute to limit the output power of
the source.
Set this attribute in the test sequence before the turning the source on.
Using a limit value of 0 results in error code 1102, "Parameter too small," for v and i. Setting this
attribute to zero disables power compliance for p. When setting the power compliance limit to a
nonzero value, the SMU adjusts the source limit where appropriate to limit the output to the specified
power. The SMU uses the lower of the programmed compliance value (the compliance level that is if
power compliance is disabled) or the limit calculated from the power compliance setting.
Reading this attribute indicates the presently set compliance value. Use
smuX.source.compliance to read the state of source compliance.
Example
smua.source.limitv = 15

Details
This attribute is used with source autoranging to put a lower bound on the range that is used. Lower
ranges generally require greater settling times. If you set a low range value, you might be able to
source small values with less settling time.
If the instrument is set to autorange and it is on a range lower than the one specified by
sourceRangeLow, the source range is changed to the range specified by sourceRangeLow.
Example
smua.source.lowrangev = 1

Sets volts low range for Models 2601B, 2602B, 2604B SMU A to 1 V.
This prevents the source from using the 100 mV range when sourcing

Source-measure unit (SMU) channel (for example, smua.source.offmode applies
to SMU channel A)

Details
Reading this attribute returns the output-off mode of the source. Setting this attribute configures the
SMU output-off mode.
The default sourceOffMode is smuX.OUTPUT_NORMAL. In this mode, the source function is
configured according to the smuX.source.offfunc attribute. The smuX.source.offfunc
attribute controls whether the SMU is configured as a 0 V voltage source or a 0 A current source.
When the SMU is operating as a 0 A current source, the smuX.source.offlimitv attribute sets
the voltage limit (similar to how the smuX.source.offlimiti attribute sets the current limit when
the SMU is operating as a 0 V voltage source).
When the sourceOffMode is set to smuX.OUTPUT_ZERO, the source is configured to output 0 V just
as smuX.OUTPUT_NORMAL mode with smuX.source.offfunc = smuX.OUTPUT_DCVOLTS. If the
source function is voltage, the current limit is not changed. If the source function is current, the
current limit is set to the current source level or 10 percent of the current source range, whichever is
greater.
When sourceOffMode is set to smuX.OUTPUT_HIGH_Z, the SMU opens the output relay when the
output is turned off.
Example
smua.source.offmode = smua.OUTPUT_HIGH_Z
Sets the output-off mode for SMU channel A to open the output relay when the output is turned off.

Details
Reading this attribute returns the output state of the source. Setting this attribute switches the output
of the source on or off.
When the output is switched on, the SMU sources either voltage or current, as set by
smuX.source.func.
Setting this attribute to smuX.OUTPUT_HIGH_Z causes the output to turn off and go to the High Z
mode. If the smuX.source.output is read after setting this attribute to smuX.OUTPUT_HIGH_Z, it
returns 0.

outputAction

▪
▪
X

0 or smuX.OE_NONE: No action
1 or smuX.OE_OUTPUT_OFF: Turns the source output off

Source-measure unit (SMU) channel (for example,
smua.source.outputenableaction applies to SMU channel A)

Details
For 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B, this attribute controls the action the SMU takes when the output enable
line is deasserted.
When set to smuX.OE_NONE, the SMU takes no action when the output enable line goes low
(deasserted).
When set to smuX.OE_OUTPUT_OFF and the output enable line is de-asserted, the SMU turns its
output off as if the smuX.source.output = smuX.OUTPUT_OFF command had been received.
The SMU does not automatically turn its output on when the output enable line returns to the
high state.
If the output enable line is not asserted when this attribute is set to smuX.OE_OUTPUT_OFF and the
output is on, the output turns off immediately.
Detection of the output enable line going low does not abort any running scripts. This may cause
execution errors.
For models that have a safety interlock (2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2635B, 2636B, and 2634B), this
attribute dictates the source output behavior when the interlock line is not engaged and the source is
configured for safe operation.
In the following situations, source output automatically turns off when the interlock is disengaged and
the output cannot be turned on unless the interlock is engaged:

•

When sourcing voltage on the 20 V range or lower.

•

When sourcing current with a limit of 20 V or less and the
smuX.source.outputenableaction attribute is set to smuX.OE_OUTPUT_OFF.

In the following situations, the source ignores the state of the interlock signal and the output can be
turned on regardless of the interlock state:

•

When sourcing voltage on the 20 V range or lower.

•

When sourcing current with a limit of 20 V or less and the
smuX.source.outputenableaction attribute is set to smuX.OE_NONE.

In the following situations, the source output automatically turns off when the interlock is disengaged,
the output cannot be turned on unless the interlock is engaged, and the
smuX.source.outputenableaction attribute is ignored:

Details
This attribute contains a value that sets the source-measure unit (SMU) to a fixed range large enough
to source the value. When read, the attribute contains the range the instrument is presently on when
in autorange.
Assigning a value to this attribute sets the SMU to a fixed range large enough to source the assigned
value. The instrument selects the best range for sourcing a value of rangeValue.
Reading this attribute returns the positive full-scale value of the source range the SMU is currently
using. With source autoranging enabled, the output level controls the range. Querying the range after
the level is set returns the range the instrument chose as appropriate for that source level.
This attribute is primarily intended to eliminate the time required by the automatic range selection
performed by a sourcing instrument. Because selecting a fixed range prevents autoranging, an
overrange condition can occur. For example, sourcing 10.0 V on the Model 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B
6 V range or sourcing 5.0 V on the 2611B, 2612B, or 2614B 2 V range causes an overrange
condition.
Example
smua.source.rangev = 1
Selects the 1 V source range for SMU channel A.

Details
This function sets the end pulse event detector to the detected state.
The SMU automatically clears all the event detectors when the smuX.trigger.initiate()
function is executed. Therefore, call smuX.trigger.endpulse.set() after the sweep is initiated.
If the event detectors are configured to clear automatically because the smuX.trigger.autoclear
attribute is set to smuX.ENABLE, make sure that smuX.trigger.endpulse.set() is issued after
the SMU has entered the trigger layer.

measurement with one of the smuX.trigger.measure.Y() functions.
If this attribute is set to smuX.ASYNC:

•

Asynchronous sweep measurements can only be used with measure autoranging turned off. To
turn measure autoranging off for all measurements during the sweep, set the
smuX.measure.autorangeY attribute to smuX.AUTORANGE_OFF.

A reading buffer object where the readings are stored
A reading buffer object where current readings are stored

Details
As measurements are made, they are stored in a reading buffer. If the instrument is configured to
return multiple readings where one is requested, the readings are available as they are made.
Measurements are in the following units of measure: v = volts, i = amperes, r = ohms, p = watts.
The smuX.trigger.measure.iv() function stores current readings in ibuffer and voltage
readings in vbuffer.
If a given reading buffer contains any data, it is cleared before making any measurements, unless the
reading buffer has been configured to append data.
The SMU only retains the last call to any one of these functions and only that measurement action is
performed.
After configuring the measurements to make with this function, enable the measurement action.
Example
smua.trigger.measure.v(vbuffername)
smua.trigger.measure.action = smua.ENABLE

Stores voltage readings during the sweep for

X

Source-measure unit (SMU) channel (for example,

Y

SMU output function (v = voltage, i = current)

Details
Use this attribute to perform extended operating area pulse mode sweeps.
If this attribute is set to smuX.LIMIT_AUTO (or 0), the SMU uses the normal limit setting during
sweeping. If this attribute is set to any other numeric value, the SMU switches in this limit at the start
of the source action and returns to the normal limit setting at the end of the end pulse action.
Normally, the limit range is automatically adjusted in accordance with the limit value. During
sweeping, however, the limit range is fixed to avoid the delays associated with changing range. This
fixed limit range is determined by the maximum limit value needed during the sweep; that is, the
greater of either the normal limit value (as specified by smuX.source.limitY) or the sweep limit
value (as specified by smuX.trigger.source.limitY). The minimum limit value that can be
enforced during the sweep is equal to 10% of the full-scale value of the fixed limit range. If the smaller
limit value (normal or sweep) falls below this 10% threshold, the 10% value is enforced instead.
Likewise, if the limit value falls below the 10% threshold as a result of power compliance, the 10%
value is enforced instead.
When using the extended operating area, the SMU automatically starts the end pulse action if the
SMU is not triggered before its maximum pulse width. It also delays the source action if necessary to
limit the pulse duty cycle to stay within the capabilities of the SMU.
Example
smua.trigger.source.limitv = 10

Sets the voltage sweep limit to 10 V.

Source value of the last point
The number of points used to calculate the step size

Details
This function configures the source action to be a linear source sweep in a subsequent sweep. During
the sweep, the source generates a uniform series of ascending or descending voltage or current
changes called steps. The number of source steps is one less than the number of sourced points.
The points parameter does not set the number of steps in a sweep. Instead, it is used to calculate
source values within a subsequent sweep. If the subsequent sweep has more points than specified in
points, the source restarts at the beginning. This means that if the trigger count is greater than the
number of points in a sweep as configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count by restarting the
sweep values from the beginning.
If the subsequent sweep has fewer points than specified in points, endValue is not reached during
the sweep. This means that if the trigger count is less than the number of source values configured,
the SMU satisfies the trigger count and ignores the remaining source values.
In cases where the first sweep point is a nonzero value, it may be necessary to pre-charge the circuit
so that the sweep returns a stable value for the first measured point without penalizing remaining
points in the sweep.
With linear sweeps, it is acceptable to maintain a fixed source resolution over the entire sweep. To
prevent source range changes during the sweep (especially when sweeping through 0.0), set the
source range to a fixed range appropriate for the larger of either startValue or endValue.
The SMU only stores the most recent configured source action. The last call to
smuX.trigger.source.linearY(), smuX.trigger.source.listY(), or
smuX.trigger.source.logY() is used for the source action.
Source functions cannot be changed within a sweep.
After configuring the sweep source values, enable the source action by setting
smuX.trigger.source.action.

smua.trigger.source.linearv(0, 10, 11)

sweepList

An array of source values

Details
This function configures the source action to be a list sweep in a subsequent sweep. During the
sweep, the source outputs the sequence of source values given in the sweepList array.
If the subsequent sweep has more points than specified in sweepList, the source restarts at the
beginning. This means that if the trigger count is greater than the number of points in a sweep as
configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count by restarting the sweep values from the beginning.
If the subsequent sweep has fewer points than specified in sweepList, the extra values are ignored.
This means that if the trigger count is less than the number of source values configured, the SMU
satisfies the trigger count and ignores the remaining source values.
In cases where the first sweep point is a nonzero value, it may be necessary to pre-charge the circuit
so that the sweep returns a stable value for the first measured point without penalizing remaining
points in the sweep.
The SMU only stores the most recent configured source action. The last call to
smuX.trigger.source.linearY(), smuX.trigger.source.listY(), or

startValue

asymptote

Source value of the first point

Details
This function configures the source action to be a geometric source sweep in a subsequent sweep.
During the sweep, the source generates a geometric series of ascending or descending voltage or
current changes called steps. Each step is larger or smaller than the previous step by a fixed
proportion. The constant of proportionality is determined by the starting value, the ending value, the
asymptote, and the number of steps in the sweep. The number of source steps is one less than the
number of sourced points.
The points parameter does not set the number of steps in a sweep, but rather is used to calculate
source values within a subsequent sweep. If the subsequent sweep has more points than specified in
points, the source restarts at the beginning. This means that if the trigger count is greater than the
number of points in a sweep as configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count by restarting the
sweep values from the beginning.
If the subsequent sweep has fewer points than specified in points, endValue is not reached during
the sweep. This means that if the trigger count is less than the number of source values configured,
the SMU satisfies the trigger count and ignores the remaining source values.
In cases where the first sweep point is nonzero, it may be necessary to pre-charge the circuit so that
the sweep returns a stable value for the first measured point without penalizing remaining points in
the sweep.
With logarithmic sweeps, it is usually necessary to allow the source to autorange to maintain good
source accuracy when sweeping over more than one decade or across range boundaries.
The asymptote parameter customizes the inflection and offset of the source value curve. This
allows log sweeps to cross zero. Setting this parameter to zero provides a conventional logarithmic
sweep. The asymptote value is the value that the curve has at either positive or negative infinity,
depending on the direction of the sweep.

The asymptote value must not be equal to or between the starting and ending values. It must be
outside the range defined by the starting and ending values.
The SMU stores only the most recent configured source action. The last call to
smuX.trigger.source.linearY(), smuX.trigger.source.listY(), or

The status of the measurement event register; a zero (0) indicates no bits set
(also send 0 to clear all bits); other values indicate various bit settings

Details
These attributes are used to read or write to the measurement event buffer available summary
registers. Reading a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value
indicates which register bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the
most significant bit is bit B15. For example, assume value 6 is returned for the enable register. The
binary equivalent is 0000 0000 0000 0110. This value indicates that bit B1 (SMUA) and bit B2
(SMUB) are set.
For information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set
contents (on page 12-1) and Enable and transition registers (on page 12-19). The individual bits of
this register are defined in the following table.

set depends on the TSP-Link node number assigned to this instrument.
For information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set
contents (on page 12-1) and Enable and transition registers (on page 12-19). The individual bits of
this register are defined in the following table.

Usage
nodeEventRegister = status.node_event
nodeEventRegister

The status of the node event register; a zero (0) indicates no bits
set; other values indicate various bit settings

Details
This attribute is used to read the status node event register, which is returned as a numeric value
(reading this register returns a value). The binary equivalent of the value of this attribute indicates
which register bits are set. In the binary equivalent, the least significant bit is bit B0, and the most
significant bit is bit B7. For example, if a value of 1.29000e+02 (which is 129) is read as the value of
this register, the binary equivalent is 1000 0001. This value indicates that bit B0 and bit B7 are set.

operationRegister

The status of the operation status digio I/O overrun register; a
zero (0) indicates no bits set (also send 0 to clear all bits); other
values indicate various bit settings

Details
These attributes are used to read or write to the operation status digital I/O overrun registers.
Reading a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value indicates which
register bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the most significant bit
is bit B15. For example, if a value of 1.02600e+03 (which is 1026) is read as the value of the
condition register, the binary equivalent is 0000 0100 0000 0010. This value indicates that bit B1 and
bit B10 are set.

status.operation.instrument.smuX.trigger_overrun.ntr = operationRegister
status.operation.instrument.smuX.trigger_overrun.ptr = operationRegister
operationRegister

The status of the operation status SMU X trigger overrun register; a zero (0)
indicates no bits set (also send 0 to clear all bits); other values indicate various bit
settings

Details
These attributes are used to read or write to the operation status SMU X trigger overrun registers.
Reading a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value indicates which
register bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the most significant bit
is bit B15. For example, if a value of 18 is read as the value of the condition register, the binary
equivalent is 0000 0000 0001 0010. This value indicates that bit B1 and bit B4 are set.

Details
These attributes are used to read or write to the operation status TSP-link overrun registers. Reading
a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value indicates which register
bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the most significant bit is bit
B15. For example, if a value of 10 is read as the value of the condition register, the binary equivalent
is 0000 0000 0000 1010. This value indicates that bit B1 and bit B3 are set.

Details
These attributes are used to read or write to the operation status user registers. Reading a status
register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the value indicates which register bits are set. In the
binary equivalent, the least significant bit is bit B0, and the most significant bit is bit B15. For example,
if a value of 1.29000e+02 (which is 129) is read as the value of the condition register, the binary
equivalent is 0000 0000 1000 0001. This value indicates that bits B0 and B7 are set.

The status of the questionable status unstable output summary
register; a zero (0) indicates no bits set (also send 0 to clear all
bits); other values indicate various bit settings

Details
These attributes are used to read or write to the questionable status unstable output summary
registers. Reading a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value
indicates which register bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the
most significant bit is bit B15.
For information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set
contents (on page 12-1) and Enable and transition registers (on page 12-19). The individual bits of
this register are defined in the following table.

As an example, to set bit B0 of the system summary 2 enable register, set
status.system2.enable = status.system2.EXT.
In addition to the above constants, enableRegister can be set to the decimal value of the bit to
set. To set more than one bit of the register, set enableRegister to the sum of their decimal
values. For example, to set bits B11 and B14, set enableRegister to 18,432 (which is the sum of
2,048 + 16,384).

The status of the system summary 3 register; a zero (0) indicates no bits set; other
values indicate various bit settings

Details
In an expanded system (TSP-Link), these attributes are used to read or write to the system summary
registers. They are set using a constant or a numeric value but are returned as a numeric value. The
binary equivalent of the value indicates which register bits are set. In the binary equivalent, the least
significant bit is bit B0 and the most significant bit is bit B15. For example, if a value of 1.29000e+02
(which is 129) is read as the value of the condition register, the binary equivalent is
0000 0000 1000 0001. This value indicates that bit B0 and bit B7 are set.

Performs a linear current sweep with voltage measured at every step (point):
1. Sets the SMU to output starti amperes, allows the source to settle for stime seconds, and
then makes a voltage measurement.
2. Sets the SMU to output the next amperes step, allows the source to settle for stime seconds,
and then makes a voltage measurement.
3. Repeats the above sequence until the voltage is measured on the stopi amperes step.
The linear step size is automatically calculated as follows:
step = (stopi – starti) / (points – 1)

This function performs a 100-point linear current sweep starting at −1 mA and stopping at +1 mA. Voltage is
measured at every step (point) in the sweep. Because stime is set for 0 s, voltage is measured as quickly as
possible after each current step.

2. Sets the SMU to output the next ilist step, allows the source to settle for stime seconds, and
then performs a voltage measurement.
3. Repeats the above sequence until the voltage is measured for the last amperes value. The last
point in the list to be measured is points.
Example

Performs a logarithmic current sweep with voltage measured at every step (point):
1. Sets the SMU to output starti amperes value, allows the source to settle for stime seconds,
and then performs a voltage measurement.
2. Sets the SMU to output the next amperes step, allows the source to settle for stime seconds,
and then performs a voltage measurement.
3. Repeats the above sequence until the voltage is measured on the stopi amperes step.
The source level at each step (SourceStepLevel) is automatically calculated as follows:
MeasurePoint = The step point number for a measurement
For example, for a five-point sweep (points = 5), a measurement is performed at MeasurePoint 1,
2, 3, 4, and 5.
LogStepSize = (log10(stopi) – log10(starti)) / (points – 1)
LogStep = (MeasurePoint – 1) * (LogStepSize)
SourceStepLevel = antilog(LogStep) * starti

Section 9: TSP command reference

When programmed to any mode except tsplink.TRIG_BYPASS, the output state of the I/O line is
controlled by the trigger logic and the user-specified output state of the line is ignored.
When the trigger mode is set to tsplink.TRIG_RISING, the user-specified output state of the line
is examined. If the output state selected when the mode is changed is high, the actual mode that is
used is tsplink.TRIG_RISINGA. If the output state selected when the mode is changed is low, the
actual mode that is used is tsplink.TRIG_RISINGM.
The mode parameter stores the trigger mode as a numeric value when the attribute is read.
To control the line state, use the tsplink.TRIG_BYPASS mode with the tsplink.writebit()
and the tsplink.writeport() commands.
Example
tsplink.trigger[3].mode = tsplink.TRIG_RISINGM
Sets the trigger mode for synchronization line 3 to tsplink.TRIG_RISINGM.

ipAddress
portNumber

IP address to which to connect in a string; accepts IP address or host name when
trying to connect
Port number (default 5025)

initString

Initialization string to send to ipAddress

Details
This command connects a device to another device through the LAN interface. If the portNumber is
23, the interface uses the Telnet protocol and sets appropriate termination characters to
communicate with the device.
If a portNumber and initString are provided, it is assumed that the remote device is not
TSP-enabled. The 2600B does not perform any extra processing, prompt handling, error handling, or
sending of commands. In addition, the tspnet.tsp.* commands cannot be used on devices that
are not TSP-enabled.
If neither a portNumber nor an initString is provided, the remote device is assumed to be a
Keithley Instruments TSP-enabled device. Depending on the state of the
tspnet.tsp.abortonconnect attribute, the 2600B sends an abort command to the remote
device on connection.
The 2600B also enables TSP prompts on the remote device and error management. The 2600B
places remote errors from the TSP-enabled device in its own error queue and prefaces these errors
with Remote Error, followed by an error description.
Do not manually change either the prompt functionality (localnode.prompts) or show errors by
changing localnode.showerrors on the remote TSP-enabled device. If you do this, subsequent
tspnet.tsp.* commands using the connection may fail.
You can simultaneously connect to a maximum of 32 remote devices.

Format string for the output

...
formatString

Details
This command sends a command string to the remote instrument. A termination is added to the
command string when it is sent to the remote instrument (tspnet.termination()). You can also
specify a format string, which causes the command to wait for a response from the remote
instrument. The 2600B decodes the response message according to the format specified in the
format string and returns the message as return values from the function (see tspnet.read() for
format specifiers).
When this command is sent to a TSP-enabled instrument, the 2600B suspends operation until a
timeout error is generated or until the instrument responds. The TSP prompt from the remote
instrument is read and discarded. The 2600B places any remotely generated errors into its error
queue. When the optional format string is not specified, this command is equivalent to
tspnet.write(), except that a termination is automatically added to the end of the command.
Example 1
tspnet.execute(instrumentID, "runScript()")
Command the remote device to run a script named runScript.

Example 2
tspnet.timeout = 5
id_instr = tspnet.connect("192.0.2.23", 23, "*rst\r\n")
tspnet.termination(id_instr, tspnet.TERM_CRLF)

%[max width]t
%[max width]n
%d

Read data until the specified length
Read data until the specified length or until punctuation is found, whichever comes first
Read data until a newline or carriage return
Read a number (delimited by punctuation)

A maximum of 10 format specifiers can be used for a maximum of 10 return values.
If formatString is not provided, the command returns a string that contains the data until a new
line is reached. If no data is available, the 2600B pauses operation until the requested data is
available or until a timeout error is generated. Use tspnet.timeout to specify the timeout period.
When the 2600B reads from a TSP-enabled remote instrument, the 2600B removes Test Script
Processor (TSP®) prompts and places any errors it receives from the remote instrument into its own
error queue. The 2600B prefaces errors from the remote device with "Remote Error," followed by
the error number and error description.
Example
tspnet.write(deviceID, "*idn?\r\n")
print("write/read returns:", tspnet.read(deviceID))
Send the "*idn?\r\n" message to the instrument connected as deviceID.
Display the response that is read from deviceID (based on the *idn? message).

instrument to close. If you do not send an abort command (or if tspnet.tsp.abortonconnect is
set to 0) and another interface is active, connecting to a TSP-enabled remote instrument results in a
connection. However, the instrument does not respond to subsequent reads or executes because
control of the instrument is not obtained until an abort command has been sent.
Example
tspnet.tsp.abortonconnect = 0
Configure the instrument so that it does not send an abort command when connecting to a
TSP-enabled instrument.

Default value

Usage
tspnet.tsp.runscript(connectionID, "script")
tspnet.tsp.runscript(connectionID, "name", "script")
connectionID

Integer value used as an identifier for other tspnet commands

name
script

The name that is assigned to the script
The body of the script as a string

Details
This function is appropriate only for TSP-enabled instruments.
This function downloads a script to a remote instrument and runs it. It automatically adds the
appropriate loadscript and endscript commands around the script, captures any errors, and
reads back any prompts. No additional substitutions are done on the text.
The script is automatically loaded, compiled, and run.
Any output from previous commands is discarded.
This command does not wait for the script to complete.
If you do not want the script to do anything immediately, make sure the script only defines functions
for later use. Use the tspnet.execute() function to execute those functions later.
If no name is specified, the script is loaded as the anonymous script.
Example
tspnet.tsp.runscript(myconnection, "mytest",
"print([[start]]) for d = 1, 10 do print([[work]]) end print([[end]])")
Load and run a script entitled mytest on the TSP-enabled instrument connected with myconnection.

Function

No

Affected by

Where saved

Default value

Usage
tspnet.write(connectionID, "inputString")
connectionID

The connection ID returned from tspnet.connect()

inputString

The string to be written

Details
The tspnet.write() function sends inputString to the remote instrument. It does not wait for
command completion on the remote instrument.
The 2600B sends inputString to the remote instrument exactly as indicated. The inputString
must contain any necessary new lines, termination, or other syntax elements needed to complete
properly.
Because tspnet.write() does not process output from the remote instrument, do not send
commands that generate too much output without processing the output. This command can stop
executing if there is too much unprocessed output from previous commands.
Example
tspnet.write(myID, "runscript()\r\n")
Commands the remote instrument to execute a command or script named runscript() on a remote device
identified in the system as myID.

Calibration
In this section:
Verification ............................................................................. 10-1
Adjustment ........................................................................... 10-15

Verification
The information in this section is intended for qualified service personnel only, as described
by the types of product users in the Safety precautions pages, provided at the beginning of
this document. Do not attempt these procedures unless you are qualified to do so.
Some of these procedures may expose you to hazardous voltages, that if contacted, could
cause personal injury or death. Use appropriate safety precautions when working with
hazardous voltages.
Use the procedures in this section to verify that the 2600B accuracy is within the limits stated in the
instrument’s one-year accuracy specifications. Perform the verification procedures:

•

When you first receive the instrument to make sure that it was not damaged during shipment.

•

To verify that the instrument meets factory specifications.

•

To determine if calibration is required.

•

After performing a calibration adjustment to make sure the instrument was adjusted properly.

The 2600B contains two independent SMU modules. Each module requires separate verification and
adjustment. The instructions in this section use the front panel. You can also use remote
programming commands. Refer to Instrument programming (on page 8-1) for information on using
commands to control the instrument.

If the instrument is still under warranty and its performance is outside specified limits, contact your
Keithley Instruments representative or the factory to determine the correct course of action.

Section 10: Calibration

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Calibration test requirements
Be sure that you perform the calibration tests:

•

Under the proper environmental conditions.

•

After the specified warmup period.

•

Using the correct line voltage.

•

Using the proper test equipment.

•

Using the specified output signal and reading limits.

Product specifications are subject to change. Listed uncertainties and test limits are provided only as
examples. Always verify values against the most recent product specifications.

Environmental conditions
Conduct your performance calibration procedures in a test environment with:

•

An ambient temperature of 18 °C to 28 °C.

•

A relative humidity of less than 70 percent unless otherwise noted.

Product specifications that are listed as 18 °C to 28 °C assume adjustment has been done at 23 °C.
If the 2600B is adjusted at a different temperature, the specifications apply to ±5 °C of that
adjustment temperature.

Line power
The 2600B requires a line voltage of 100 V to 240 V and a line frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Perform
calibration tests in this range.

Warmup period
Allow the 2600B to warm up for at least two hours before conducting the calibration procedures.
If the instrument has been subjected to temperature extremes (those outside the ranges stated
above), allow additional time for the internal temperature of the instrument to stabilize. Typically, allow
one extra hour to stabilize an instrument that is 10 °C outside the specified temperature range.
Also allow test equipment to warm up for the minimum time specified by the manufacturer.

Calibration limits
The calibration limits stated in this section have been calculated using only the 2600B one-year
accuracy specifications. They do not include test equipment uncertainty. If a particular measurement
falls outside the allowable range, recalculate new limits based both on the 2600B specifications and
corresponding test equipment specifications.

Source limit calculations
As an example of how verification limits are calculated, assume you are testing the 2601B, 2602B, or
2604B 6 V dc output range using a 5.4 V output value. Using the one-year accuracy specification for
5.4 V dc output of ± (0.02% of output + 1.8 mV offset), the calculated output limits are:
Output limits = 5.4 V ± [(5.4 V × 0.02%) + 1.8 mV]
Output limits = 5.4 V ± (0.00108 V + 0.0018 V)
Output limits = 5.4 V ± 0.00288 V
Output limits = 5.39712 V to 5.40288 V
Similarly, assume you are testing the Model 2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2635B, or 2636B 20 V dc
output range using an 18 V output value. Using the one-year accuracy specification for 18 V dc output
of ± (0.02% of output + 5 mV offset), the calculated output limits are:
Output limits = 18 V ± [(18 V × 0.02%) + 5 mV]
Output limits = 18 V ± (0.0036 V + 0.005 V)
Output limits = 18 V ± 0.0086 V
Output limits = 17.9914 V to 18.0086 V

Measurement limit calculations
Measurement limits are calculated in the same way as the source limits, except that the limits are
calculated with respect to the measurement of the external reference instrument.

Restoring factory defaults
Before performing the calibration procedures, restore the instrument to its factory defaults.
To restore the factory defaults:
1. Press the MENU key.
2. Scroll to the SETUP menu item, and then press the ENTER key.
3. Scroll to the RECALL menu item, and then press the ENTER key.
4. Scroll to the INTERNAL menu item, and then press the ENTER key.
5. Scroll to the FACTORY menu item.
6. Press the ENTER key to restore defaults.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 10: Calibration

Performing the calibration test procedures
Perform the following calibration tests to make sure the instrument is operating within specifications:

•

Current source accuracy (on page 10-6)

•

Current measurement accuracy (on page 10-9)

•

Voltage source accuracy (on page 10-12)

•

Voltage measurement accuracy (on page 10-14)

If the 2600B is not within specifications and not under warranty, see the procedures in Adjustment (on
page 10-15) for information on adjusting the instrument.

Test considerations
When performing the calibration procedures:

•

Be sure to restore factory front panel defaults as described in Restoring factory defaults (on
page 10-4).

•

Make sure that the test equipment is properly warmed up and connected to the 2600B output
terminals. Use 4-wire sensing for voltage.

•

Make sure the 2600B SMU is set to the correct source range.

•

Be sure the 2600B SMU output is turned on before making measurements.

•

Be sure the test equipment is set up for the proper function and range.

•

Allow the 2600B SMU output signal to settle before making a measurement.

•

Do not connect test equipment to the 2600B through a scanner, multiplexer, or other
switching equipment.

The maximum common-mode voltage (voltage between LO and chassis ground) is 250 V dc.
Exceeding this value may cause a breakdown in insulation, creating a shock hazard that
could result in personal injury or death.

The FORCE and SENSE connectors of the 2600B are rated for connection to circuits rated
Measurement Category I only, with transients rated less than 1500 VPEAK. Do not connect the
2600B terminals to CAT II, CAT III, or CAT IV circuits. Connections of the input/output
connectors to circuits higher than CAT I can cause damage to the equipment or expose the
operator to hazardous voltages.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

10-5

Section 10: Calibration

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Hazardous voltages may be present on all output and guard terminals. To prevent electrical
shock that could cause injury or death, never make or break connections to the 2600B while
the instrument is powered on. Turn off the equipment from the front panel or disconnect the
main power cord from the rear of the 2600B before handling cables. Putting the equipment
into standby does not guarantee that the outputs are powered off if a hardware or software
fault occurs.

Setting the source range and output value
Before testing each calibration point, you must properly set the source range and output value.
To set the source range and output value:
1. Press the SRC key to select the appropriate source function.
2. Press the navigation wheel to enable the edit mode (EDIT indicator on).
3. When the cursor in the source display field is flashing, set the source range to the range being
calibrated. Use the up or down RANGE keys to select the range.
4. Use the navigation wheel and CURSOR keys to set the source value to the required value.
5. Press the navigation wheel to complete editing.

Setting the measurement range
When simultaneously sourcing and measuring either voltage or current, the measure range is coupled
to the source range, and you cannot independently control the measure range. Thus, it is not
necessary for you to set the range when testing voltage or current measurement accuracy (on
page 10-9).

Current source accuracy
Follow the steps below to verify that the 2600B output current accuracy is within specified limits.

An alternate procedure for 100 nA current accuracy is shown in the 1 nA to 100 nA Output current
accuracy procedure for the 2634B, 2635B, or 2636B.
1. With the power off, connect the digital multimeter to the 2600B terminals as shown in the figure
titled "Connections for 100 nA to 1 A current ranges" located at the end of this procedure.
2. Select the multimeter dc current measuring function.
3. Select the Model 2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, or 2636B single-channel display mode.
4. Press the SRC key to source current, and make sure the source output is turned on.

Adjustment
The information in this section is intended for qualified service personnel only, as described
by the types of product users in the Safety precautions pages, provided at the beginning of
this document. Do not attempt these procedures unless you are qualified to do so.
Some of these procedures may expose you to hazardous voltages, that if contacted, could
cause personal injury or death. Use appropriate safety precautions when working with
hazardous voltages.
Use the procedures in this section to calibrate the 2600B.
These procedures require accurate test equipment to measure precise dc voltages and currents.

Product specifications are subject to change. Listed uncertainties and test limits are provided only as
an example. Always verify values against actual product specifications.

Environmental conditions
Temperature and relative humidity
Conduct the adjustment procedures at an ambient temperature of 18 °C to 28 °C, with relative
humidity of less than 70 percent (unless otherwise noted).

Product specifications that are listed as 18 °C to 28 °C assume adjustment has been done at 23 °C.
If the 2600B is adjusted at a different temperature, the specifications apply to ±5 °C of that
temperature.

Line power
The 2600B requires a line voltage of 100 V to 240 V at a line frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. The
instrument must be adjusted within this range.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

10-15

Section 10: Calibration

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Warmup period
Allow the 2600B to warm up for at least two hours before adjusting the instrument.
If the instrument has been subjected to temperature extremes (those outside the ranges stated
above), allow additional time for the internal temperature of the instrument to stabilize. Typically, allow
one extra hour to stabilize an instrument that is 10 °C outside the specified temperature range.
Allow the test equipment to warm up for the minimum time specified by the manufacturer.

Adjustment considerations
When performing the adjustment procedures:

•

Make sure that the test equipment is properly warmed up and connected to the correct 2600B
terminals.

•

Always allow the source signal to settle before adjusting each point.

•

Do not connect test equipment to the 2600B through a scanner or other switching equipment.

•

If an error occurs during adjustment, the 2600B generates an appropriate error message. See the
Error summary list (on page 6-2) for more information.

The maximum common-mode voltage (voltage between LO and chassis ground) is 250 V dc.
Exceeding this value may cause a breakdown in insulation, creating a shock hazard that
could result in personal injury or death.

The FORCE and SENSE connectors of the 2600B are rated for connection to circuits rated
Measurement Category I only, with transients rated less than 1500 VPEAK. Do not connect the
2600B terminals to CAT II, CAT III, or CAT IV circuits. Connections of the input/output
connectors to circuits higher than CAT I can cause damage to the equipment or expose the
operator to hazardous voltages.

Hazardous voltages may be present on all output and guard terminals. To prevent electrical
shock that could cause injury or death, never make or break connections to the 2600B while
the instrument is powered on. Turn off the equipment from the front panel or disconnect the
main power cord from the rear of the 2600B before handling cables. Putting the equipment
into standby does not guarantee that the outputs are powered off if a hardware or software
fault occurs.

Calibration adjustment overview
The following topics contain an overview of the entire calibration adjustment procedure.

Parameter values
The full-scale parameters are 90 percent of full-scale as indicated (see the table in Step sequence (on
page 10-18)). Note that you cannot send a value of 0 for the two zero parameters. Instead, you must
send a very small value, such as 1e-30 or -1e-30.

Sense modes
The preceding table for your specific model lists the sense modes for the calibration steps. Note that
each source and measure range is calibrated using the LOCAL sense mode.
In addition, for the 2601B, 2602B, and 2604B, the 100 mV source and measure range is also
calibrated using the REMOTE sense mode, and the 1 V and 1 mA source ranges are also calibrated
using the CALA sense mode.
For the Model 2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2635B, and 2636B, the 200 mV source and measure
range is also calibrated using the REMOTE sense mode, and the 2 V and 1 mA source ranges are
also calibrated using the CALA sense mode.

Step sequence
Adjustment steps must be performed in a specific sequence. See the following table for your model.
All steps are performed using 2-wire (local sensing) except as noted. Adjustment of each range is
performed as a four-point calibration:
▪

+ ZERO

▪

+ FULL SCALE

▪

− ZERO

▪

− FULL SCALE

Before performing the adjustment steps, refer to Parameter values (on page 10-18) and Sense
modes (on page 10-18).

Adjustment procedure
Use the following procedure to perform remote calibration adjustment by sending commands over a
communications interface. The remote commands and appropriate parameters are separately
summarized for each step.

Step 1. Prepare the 2600B for adjustment
A. Connect the 2600B to the controller IEEE-488 interface, RS-232 port, USB interface, or LAN
using an appropriate interface cable.
B. Turn on the 2600B and the test equipment. Allow them to warm up for at least two hours before
performing adjustment.
C. Make sure the IEEE-488, RS-232, or LAN interface parameters are set up properly. To configure
the interface, press the MENU key, and then select RS232, LAN, or GPIB, as applicable;
configuration of the USB interface is not necessary so it is not available.

Step 2. Voltage calibration adjustment
A. Connect the 2600B SMU to the digital multimeter using the 4-wire connections shown in the
figure below. Select the multimeter dc volts function.
Figure 132: Connections for voltage calibration

B. Send the following commands to initialize voltage calibration:
smua.cal.unlock("KI0026XX")
smua.reset()
smua.source.func = smua.OUTPUT_DCVOLTS

Section 10: Calibration

It is not necessary to set the measure range when following this procedure for calibration because
the measure range is locked to the source range when measuring the source function.
C. Perform each calibration adjustment for the voltage source and measure function step listed in
Step sequence (on page 10-18) as follows:
1.

Select the range being calibrated with this command:
smua.source.rangev = range

2.

Select the correct sense mode based on the calibration step for the voltage source and measure
function from the Step sequence (on page 10-18), for example:
smua.sense = smua.SENSE_LOCAL

3.

Select positive polarity, and then set the source output to the positive zero value. For example:
smua.cal.polarity = smua.CAL_POSITIVE
smua.source.levelv = 1e-30

4.

Turn on the output:
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_ON

5.

Allow the readings to settle, then get both the multimeter and 2600B voltage readings at the positive
zero value (the 2600B measurement is not necessary if this calibration step is being done on the CALA
sense mode). The two measurements should be made as close as possible in time. Use this command
for the 2600B:
Z_rdg = smua.measure.v()

6.

Turn off the output:
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_OFF

7.

Set the source output to the positive full-scale value for the present range, for example:
smua.source.levelv = 0.9 (Model 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B)
smua.source.levelv = 1.8 (Model 2611B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, 2635B, 2636B)

8.

Turn on the output:
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_ON

9.

Allow the readings to settle, then get both the multimeter and 2600B voltage readings at the positive
full-scale output value (the 2600B measurement is not necessary if this calibration step is being done on
the CALA sense mode). The two measurements should be made as close as possible in time. Use this
command for the 2600B:

15. Allow the readings to settle, then get both the multimeter and 2600B current readings at the negative
zero value (the 2600B measurement is not necessary if this calibration step is being done on the CALA
sense). The two measurements should be made as close as possible in time. Use this command for
the 2600B:
Z_rdg = smua.measure.i()
16. Turn off the output:
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_OFF
17. Set the source output to the negative full-scale value, for example:
smua.source.leveli = -90e-3
18. Turn on the output:
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_ON
19. Allow the readings to settle, then get both the multimeter and 2600B current readings at the negative
full-scale output value (the 2600B measurement is not necessary if this calibration step is being done on
the CALA sense mode). The two measurements should be made as close as possible in time. Use this
command for the 2600B:
FS_rdg = smua.measure.i()
20. Turn off the output:
smua.source.output = smua.OUTPUT_OFF
21. Send the source calibration command using the -range, -zero and -FS multimeter readings, and -zero

Models 2634B, 2635B, and 2636B:
1. Connect the 2600B to the digital multimeter. Use the figure titled "Connections for current
calibration (1.5 A through 10 A ranges)" as a guideline, but replace the 0.5 Ω resistor with the 1
GΩ resistor.
2. Select the multimeter dc current function.
3. Calibrate the low current ranges (100 pA, 1 nA, 10 nA, 100 nA, see Note) using a suitably
guarded and characterized 1 GΩ resistance standard, such as the Keithley Instruments Model
2600-STD-RES (see Recommended calibration adjustment equipment (on page 10-17)).
Step-by-step procedures, connection diagrams, and a factory script for calibrating the low current
ranges are included with the Model 2600-STD-RES. The general process entails forcing a
characterized voltage across the 1 GΩ resistor and comparing the 2634B, 2635B, or 2636B
measured results against the standard resistance and voltage derived current.

The 2601B, 2602B, 2604B, 2611B, 2612B, 2614B could be calibrated with this method for the
100 nA setting if desired.
4. Characterize the appropriate ± V source values with the Digital Multimeter according to the 2634B,
2635B, or 2636B calibration Step sequence (on page 10-18).
5. Characterize the 2634B, 2635B, or 2636B current ranges.
a.

Connect the guarded resistance standard.

b.

Source the appropriate voltage for ± full-scale reading.

c.

Where r0_lo is the same value as measured in step B, and r50_lo is the same value as
measured in step E.
G. Send the contact check high calibration command:
smua.contact.calibratehi(r0_hi, Z_actual, r50_hi, 50_ohm_actual)
Where:
r0_hi
Z_actual

= 2600B 0 Ω high measurement
= Actual zero value; the resistance of the short between the SENSE HI and HI
terminals
r50_hi
= 2600B 50 Ω high measurement

Where r0_hi is the same value as measured in step B, and r50_hi is the same value as
measured in step E.

Step 6. Program calibration dates
Use the following command to set the calibration adjustment date:
smua.cal.adjustdate = os.time{year=2019, month=12, day=1}
Optionally, it is possible to set the calibration date and calibration due date with the
following commands:
smua.cal.date = os.time{year=2019, month=12, day=1}
smua.cal.due = os.time{year=2020, month=12, day=1}
If you do not wish to set a calibration date or calibration due date and want to clear the previous
values, use the following commands:
smua.cal.date = 0
smua.cal.due = 0

Section 10: Calibration

The actual year, month, day, and (optional) hour and minute should be used (seconds can be given
but are essentially ignored due to the precision of the internal date storage format). The allowable
range for the year is from 1970 to 2037, the month is from 1 to 12, and the day is from 1 to 31.

Step 7. Save calibration constants
Calibration adjustment is now complete, so you can store the calibration constants in nonvolatile
memory by sending the following command:
smua.cal.save()

Unless you send the save command, the calibration adjustment you just performed is temporary.

Step 8. Lock out calibration
To lock out further calibration adjustment, send the following command after completing the
adjustment procedure:
smua.cal.lock()

Step 9. Repeat calibration procedure for Channel B
For the 2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, or 2636B only, repeat the entire procedure above for
Channel B. Be sure to:

•

Make test connections to Channel B terminals.

•

Substitute "smub" for "smua" in all commands.

Details of all common commands (except those associated with the status model) are
described below.

Status command usage is in the Status model (on page 12-1).

Identification query: *IDN?
Retrieves the identification string.
*IDN?

Command that reads ID information

The identification string includes the manufacturer, model number, serial number, and firmware
revision levels. This string is sent in the following format:
Keithley Instruments, Model 2600B, xxxxxxx, yyyyy

Where:
xxxxxxx is the serial number
yyyyy is the firmware revision level

Operation complete and query: *OPC and *OPC?
Wait for pending overlapped commands to complete.
*OPC

Operation complete command that sets the OPC bit

*OPC?

Operation complete query that places a "1" in the output queue

When *OPC is sent, the OPC bit in the Standard Event Register (see Status model (on page 12-1)) is
set when all overlapped commands complete. The *OPC? command places an ASCII "1" in the
output queue when all previous overlapped commands complete.

Reset: *RST
Returns the instrument to default conditions.
*RST

Command that returns the instrument to default conditions

When the *RST command is sent, the instrument returns to the default conditions. This performs the
same actions as reset() (on page 9-177).

*TST?

Places a zero (0) in the output queue

This command always places a zero (0) in the output queue. This command is included for common
command compatibility only; the 2600B does not actually perform a self-test.

Trigger: *TRG
Generates a command interface trigger event for the trigger model.
*TRG

This command generates the trigger.EVENT_ID trigger event for the trigger model

The trigger.EVENT_ID is a constant that contains the command interface trigger event number.
You can set the stimulus of any trigger object to the value of this constant to have the trigger object
respond to the trigger events generated by this command. See trigger.EVENT_ID (on page 9-373)
and Using the remote trigger model (on page 4-3).

Wait-to-continue: *WAI
Suspends the execution of subsequent commands until all previous overlapped commands
are finished.
*WAI

This pauses until overlapped commands are complete

Two types of device commands exist:

•

Overlapped commands. Commands that allow the execution of subsequent commands while
instrument operations of the overlapped command are still in progress.

•

Sequential commands. Commands whose operations finish before the next command
is executed.

The *WAI command suspends the execution of subsequent commands until the instrument
operations of all previous overlapped commands are finished. The *WAI command is not needed for
sequential commands.

REN
The remote enable (REN) command is sent to the 2600B by the controller to set up the instrument for
remote operation. Generally, place the instrument in the remote mode before you attempt to program
it over the bus. Setting REN to true does not place the instrument in the remote state. You must
address the instrument to listen after setting REN to true before it goes into remote operation.

IFC
The interface clear (IFC) command is sent by the controller to place the 2600B in the talker idle state
and the listener idle state. The instrument responds to the IFC command by canceling illumination of
the front-panel TALK or LSTN lights if the instrument was previously placed in one of these states.
Transfer of command messages to the instrument and transfer of response messages from the
instrument are not interrupted by the IFC command. If transfer of a response message from the
instrument was suspended by IFC, transfer of the message resumes when the instrument is
addressed to talk. If transfer of a command message to the instrument was suspended by the IFC
command, the rest of the message can be sent when the instrument is addressed to listen.

LLO
When the instrument is in remote operation, all front-panel controls are disabled, except the LOCAL
and OUTPUT OFF keys (and the POWER switch). The local lockout (LLO) command disables the
LOCAL key, but does not affect the OUTPUT OFF switch, which cannot be disabled.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Section 11: Common commands

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

GTL
Use the go to local (GTL) command to put a remote-mode instrument into local mode. Leaving the
remote state also restores operation of all front-panel controls.

DCL
Use the device clear (DCL) command to clear the GPIB interface and return it to a known state. The
DCL command is not an addressed command, so all instruments equipped to implement DCL are
returned to a known state simultaneously.
When the 2600B receives a DCL command, it:

•

Clears the input buffer, output queue, and command queue

•

Cancels deferred commands

•

Clears any command that prevents the processing of any other device command

The DCL command does not affect instrument settings and stored data.

SDC
The selective device clear (SDC) command is an addressed command that performs essentially the
same function as the device clear (DCL) command. However, because each device must be
individually addressed, the SDC command provides a method to clear only selected instruments,
instead of clearing all instruments simultaneously with the DCL command.
When the 2600B receives an SDC command, it:

•

Clears the input buffer, output queue, and command queue

•

Cancels deferred commands

•

Clears any command that prevents the processing of any other device command

An SDC call does not affect instrument settings and stored data.

GET
The group execute trigger (GET) command is a GPIB trigger that triggers the instrument to make
readings from a remote interface.

SPE, SPD
Use the serial polling sequence to obtain the 2600B serial poll byte. The serial poll byte contains
important information about internal functions (see Status model (on page 12-1)). Generally, the serial
polling sequence is used by the controller to determine which of several instruments has requested
service with the SRQ line. The serial polling sequence may be performed at any time to obtain the
status byte from the 2600B.

Overview
Each Keithley Instruments 2600B provides status registers and queues that are collectively referred
to as the status model. Through manipulation and monitoring of these registers and queues, you can
view and control various instrument events. You can include commands in your test program that can
determine if a service request (SRQ) event has occurred and the cause of the event.
The heart of the status model is the Status Byte Register. All status model registers and queues flow
into the Status Byte Register.
The entire status model is illustrated in the Status model diagrams (on page 12-5).

Status register set contents
Typically, a status register set contains the following registers:

•

Condition (.condition): A read-only register that is constantly updated to reflect the present
operating conditions of the instrument.

•

Enable Register (.enable): A read-write register that allows a summary bit to be set when an
enabled event occurs.

•

Event Register (.event): A read-only register that sets a bit to 1 when the applicable event
occurs. If the enable register bit for that event is also set, the summary bit of the register is set
to 1.

•

Negative Transition Register (NTR) (.ntr): When a bit is set in this read-write register, it
enables a 1 to 0 change in the corresponding bit of the condition register to cause the
corresponding bit in the event register to be set.

•

Positive Transition Register (PTR) (.ptr): When a bit is set in this read-write register, it
enables a 0 to 1 change in the corresponding bit of the condition register to cause the
corresponding bit in the event register to be set.

Section 12: Status model

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

An event is represented by a condition register bit changing from a 1 to 0 or 0 to 1. When an event
occurs and the appropriate NTR or PTR bit is set, the corresponding event register bit is set to 1. The
event bit remains latched to 1 until the event register is read or the status model is reset. When an
event register bit is set and its corresponding enable bit is set, the summary bit of the register is set
to 1. This, in turn, sets a bit in a higher-level condition register, potentially cascading to the associated
summary bit of the Status Byte Register.

Queues
The 2600B uses queues to store messages. The queues include:

•

Command queue: Holds commands that are available for execution.

•

Output queue: Holds response messages.

•

Error queue: Holds error and status messages.

When a queue contains data, it sets the condition bit for that queue in one of the registers. The
condition bits are:

•

Command queue: CAV in the Operation Status Remote Summary Register

•

Output queue: MAV in the Status Byte Register

•

Error queue: EAV in the Status Byte Register

The CAV, MAV, and EAV bits in the registers are cleared when the queue is empty. Queues
empty when:

•

Commands are executed

•

Errors are read from the error queue

•

Response messages are read from the instrument

All 2600B queues are first-in, first-out (FIFO).
The Status model diagrams (on page 12-5) shows how the queues are structured with the
other registers.

Command queue
The command queue holds commands that have been received from a remote interface that are
available for execution. This allows the 2600B to accept multiple commands and queue them for
execution.
When a command is received from a remote interface, the command available (CAV) bit in the
Operation Status Remote Summary Register is set. For additional detail, see
status.operation.remote.* (on page 9-325).

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 12: Status model

Output queue
Response messages, such as those generated from print commands, are placed in the output queue.
All remote command interfaces share the same output queue.
The output queue sets the message available (MAV) bit in the status model.
The data in the output queue is cleared by the *CLS command.

Error queue
The error queue holds error and status messages. As programming errors and status messages
occur, a message that defines the error or status is placed in the error queue.
An error or status message is cleared from the error queue when it is read. You can also clear the
error queue by sending the command errorqueue.clear(). An empty error queue clears the error
available (EAV) bit in the Status Byte Register.
Messages in the error queue include a code number, message text, severity, and TSP-Link® node
number. See Error summary list (on page 6-2) for a list of the messages.
When you read a single message from the error queue, the oldest message is read. If you attempt to
read the error queue when it is empty, the error number 0 and “No Error” is returned.
The commands used to control the error queue are listed in the following table.

Clearing registers
You can use commands to reset the status registers.
*CLS resets the bits of the event and NTR registers to 0 and sets all PTR register bits on. This
command also clears the output queue.
status.reset() resets bits of the event and NTR registers to 0 and sets all PTR register bits on.
Refer to status.reset() (on page 9-346) for additional information.
In addition to these commands, you can reset the enable registers and the NTR to 0. To do this, send
the individual command to program the register with a 0 as its parameter value. The PTR registers
can be reset to their defaults by programming them with all bits on. The event registers are not
programmable but you can clear them by reading them.

Programming enable and transition registers
The only registers that you can program are the enable and transition registers. All other registers in
the status structure are read-only registers. The following explains how to determine the parameter
values for the various commands used to program enable registers. The actual commands are
summarized in Common commands (on page 11-1) and Status function summary (on page 12-3).
A command to program an event enable or transition register is sent with a parameter value that
determines the state (0 or 1) of each bit in the appropriate register. The bit positions of the register
(see the following tables) indicate the binary parameter value and decimal equivalent. To program
one of the registers, send the decimal value for the bits to be set. The registers are discussed further
in Enable and transition registers (on page 12-19).

When using a numeric parameter, registers are programmed by including the appropriate mask value.
For example:
*ese 1169
status.standard.enable = 1169

To convert from decimal to binary, use the information shown in the above figure. For example, to set
bits B0, B4, B7, and B10, use a decimal value of 1169 for the mask parameter
(1169 = 1 + 16 + 128 + 1024).

Section 12: Status model

Reading registers
Any register in the status structure can be read either by sending the common command query
(where applicable), or by including the script command for that register in either the print() or
print(tostring()) command. The print() command outputs a numeric value; the
print(tostring()) command outputs the string equivalent. For example, any of the following
commands requests the Service Request Enable Register value:
*SRE?
print(tostring(status.request_enable))
print(status.request_enable)

The response message is a decimal value that indicates which bits in the register are set. That value
can be converted to its binary equivalent using the information in Programming enable and transition
registers (on page 12-14). For example, for a decimal value of 37 (binary value of 100101), bits B5,
B2, and B0 are set.

Status byte and service request (SRQ)
Service requests (SRQs) allow an instrument to indicate that it needs attention or that some event
has occurred. When the controller receives an SRQ, it allows the controller to interrupt tasks to
perform other tasks in order to address the request for service.
For example, you might program your instrument to send an SRQ when:

•

All instrument operations are complete

•

An instrument error occurs

•

A specific operation has occurred

Two 8-bit registers control service requests: The Status Byte Register and the Service Request
Enable Register. See Status Byte Register (on page 12-16) for a description of the structure of these
registers.
Service requests affect GPIB, USB, and VXI-11 connections. On a GPIB connection, the SRQ line is
asserted. On a VXI-11 or USB connection, an SRQ event is generated.

Section 12: Status model

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Status Byte Register
The summary messages from the status registers and queues are used to set or clear the appropriate
bits (B0, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and B7) of the Status Byte Register. These summary bits do not latch,
and their states (0 or 1) are dependent upon the summary messages (0 or 1). For example, if the
Standard Event Register is read, its register is cleared. As a result, its summary message resets to 0,
which then resets the ESB bit in the Status Byte Register.
The Status Byte Register also receives summary bits from itself, which sets the Master Summary
Status, or MSS, bit.

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Section 12: Status model

The bits of the Status Byte Register are described as follows:

•

Bit B0, Measurement Summary Bit (MSB): Set summary bit indicates that an enabled
measurement event has occurred.

•

Bit B1, System Summary Bit (SSB): Set summary bit indicates that an enabled system event
has occurred.

•

Bit B2, Error Available (EAV): Set bit indicates that an error or status message is present in the
error queue.

•

Bit B3, Questionable Summary Bit (QSB): Set summary bit indicates that an enabled
questionable event has occurred.

•

Bit B4, Message Available (MAV): Set bit indicates that a response message is present in the
output queue.

•

Bit B5, Event Summary Bit (ESB): Set summary bit indicates that an enabled standard event
has occurred.

•

Bit B6, Request Service (RQS)/Master Summary Status (MSS): Set bit indicates that an
enabled summary bit of the Status Byte Register is set. Depending on how it is used, bit B6 of the
Status Byte Register is either the Request for Service (RQS) bit or the Master Summary Status
(MSS) bit:
▪

When using the GPIB, USB, or VXI-11 serial poll sequence of the 2600B to obtain the status
byte (serial poll byte), B6 is the RQS bit. See Serial polling and SRQ (on page 12-18) for
details on using the serial poll sequence.

▪

When using the *STB? common command or status.condition Status byte and service
request commands (on page 12-19) to read the status byte, B6 is the MSS bit.

•

Bit B7, Operation Summary (OSB): Set summary bit indicates that an enabled operation event
has occurred.

Service Request Enable Register
The Service Request Enable Register controls the generation of a service request. This register is
programmed by the user and is used to enable or disable the setting of bit B6 (RQS/MSS) by the
Status Summary Message bits (B0, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and B7) of the Status Byte Register. As
shown in Status Byte Register (on page 12-16), a logical AND operation is performed on the
summary bits (&) with the corresponding enable bits of the Service Request Enable Register. When a
logical AND operation is performed with a set summary bit (1) and with an enabled bit (1) of the
enable register, the logic “1” output is applied to the input of the logical OR gate and, therefore, sets
the MSS/RQS bit in the Status Byte Register.

12-17

Section 12: Status model

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

You can set or clear the individual bits of the Service Request Enable Register by using the *SRE
common command or status.request_enable. To read the Service Request Enable Register,
use the *SRE? query or print(status.request_enable). The Service Request Enable Register
clears when power is cycled or a parameter value of 0 is sent with a status request enable command
(for example, a *SRE 0 or status.request_enable = 0 is sent). The commands to program and
read the SRQ Enable Register are listed in Status byte and service request commands (on
page 12-19).

Serial polling and SRQ
Any enabled event summary bit that goes from 0 to 1 sets bit B6 and generates a service request
(SRQ).
In your test program, you can periodically read the Status Byte to check if an SRQ occurred and what
caused it. If an SRQ occurred, the program can, for example, branch to an appropriate subroutine
that services the request.
SRQs can be managed by the serial poll sequence of the instrument. If an SRQ does not occur, bit
B6 (RQS) of the Status Byte Register remains cleared, and the program proceeds normally after the
serial poll is performed. If an SRQ does occur, bit B6 of the Status Byte Register is set, and the
program can branch to a service subroutine when the SRQ is detected by the serial poll.
The serial poll automatically resets RQS of the Status Byte Register. This allows subsequent serial
polls to monitor bit B6 for an SRQ occurrence that is generated by other event types.
The serial poll does not clear the low-level registers that caused the SRQ to occur. You must clear the
low-level registers explicitly. Refer to Clearing registers (on page 12-14).
For common commands and TSP commands, B6 is the MSS (Message Summary Status) bit. The
serial poll does not clear the MSS bit. The MSS bit remains set until all enabled Status Byte Register
summary bits are reset.

SPE, SPD (serial polling)
For the GPIB interface only, the SPE and SPD general bus commands are used to serial poll the
System SourceMeter® instrument. Serial polling obtains the serial poll byte (status byte). Typically,
serial polling is used by the controller to determine which of several instruments has requested
service with the SRQ line.

Enable and transition registers
In general, there are three types of user-writable registers that are used to configure which bits feed
the register summary bit and when it occurs. The registers are identified in each applicable command
(as listed in TSP commands (on page 9-7)) as follows:

•

Enable register (identified as .enable in the command listing of each attribute): Allows various
associated events to be included in the summary bit for the register.

•

Negative-transition register (identified as .ntr in the command listing of each attribute): A
particular bit in the event register is set when the corresponding bit in the NTR is set, and the
corresponding bit in the condition register transitions from 1 to 0.

•

Positive-transition register (identified as .ptr in the command listing of each attribute): A
particular bit in the event register is set when the corresponding bit in the PTR is set, and the
corresponding bit in the condition register transitions from 0 to 1.

Controlling node and SRQ enable registers
Attributes to control system node and service request (SRQ) enable bits and read associated
registers are summarized in the Status byte and service request enable registers (on page 12-5). For
example, either of the following commands set the system node QSB enable bit:
status.node_enable = status.QSB
status.node_enable = 8

Status register sets
There are five status register sets in the status structure of a System SourceMeter® instrument:

•

System Summary

•

Standard Event Status

•

Operation Status

•

Questionable Status

•

Measurement Event

System Summary Registers
As shown in Status model diagrams (on page 12-5), there are five register sets associated with
system status events. These registers summarize the system status for various nodes connected to
the TSP-Link® network (see TSP-Link system expansion interface (on page 8-83)). Note that all
nodes on the TSP-Link network share a copy of the system summary registers once the TSP-Link
system has been initialized. This feature allows all nodes to access the status models of other nodes,
including service request (SRQ).
In a TSP-Link system, you can configure the status model so that a status event in any node in the
system can set the RQS (request for service) bit of the Master Node Status Byte. See TSP-Link
system status (on page 12-25) for details on using the status model in a TSP-Link system.
Commands for the system summary registers are summarized in the Status function summary (on
page 12-3) table.
For example, either of the following commands sets the EXT enable bit:
status.system.enable = status.system.EXT
status.system.enable = 1

When reading a register, a numeric value is returned. The binary equivalent of this value indicates
which bits in the register are set. For details, see Reading registers (on page 12-15). For example, the
following command reads the System Enable Register:
print(status.system.enable)
The used bits of the system event registers are described as follows:

•

Bit B0, Extension Bit (EXT): Set bit indicates that an extension bit from another system status
register is set.

•

Bits B1 to B14 NODEn: Indicates a bit on TSP-Link node n has been set (n = 1 to 64) (note that
status.system5 does not use bits B9 through B15).

response to an *OPC command. The opc() function can be used in place of the *OPC command.
See Common commands (on page 11-1) for details on the *OPC command.

•

Bit B1: Not used.

•

Bit B2, Query Error (QYE): Set bit indicates that you attempted to read data from an empty
output queue.

•

Bit B3, Device-Dependent Error (DDE): Set bit indicates that an instrument operation did not
execute properly due to some internal condition.

•

Bit B4, Execution Error (EXE): Set bit indicates that the 2600B instrument detected an error
while trying to execute a command.

•

Bit B5, Command Error (CME): Set bit indicates that a command error has occurred. Command
errors include:
▪

IEEE Std 488.2 syntax error: The 2600B instrument received a message that does not follow
the defined syntax of IEEE Std 488.2.

▪

Semantic error: 2600B instrument received a command that was misspelled or received an
optional IEEE Std 488.2 command that is not implemented.

▪

The instrument received a Group Execute Trigger (GET) inside a program message.

•

Bit B6, User Request (URQ): Set bit indicates that the LOCAL key on the 2600B instrument front
panel was pressed.

•

Bit B7, Power ON (PON): Set bit indicates that the 2600B instrument has been turned off and
turned back on since the last time this register was read.

Register programming example
The command sequence below programs the instrument to generate a service request (SRQ) and set
the system summary bit in all TSP-Link nodes when the current limit on channel A is exceeded.
-- Clear all registers.
status.reset()
-- Enable current limit bit in current limit register.
status.measurement.current_limit.enable = status.measurement.current_limit.SMUA
-- Enable status measure current limit bit.
status.measurement.enable = status.measurement.ILMT
-- Set system summary; enable MSB.
status.node_enable = status.MSB
-- Enable status SRQ MSB.
status.request_enable = status.MSB

TSP-Link system status
TSP-Link® is not available on the 2604B, 2614B, or 2634B.
The TSP-Link® expansion interface allows instruments to communicate with each other. The test
system can be expanded to include up to 32 TSP-enabled instruments. In a TSP-Link system, one
node (instrument) is the master and the other nodes are the subordinates. The master can control the
other nodes (subordinates) in the system. See TSP-Link system expansion interface (on page 8-83)
for details about the TSP-Link system.
The system summary registers, shown in the Status byte and service request enable register (on
page 12-5) and the System summary and standard event registers (on page 12-6), are shared by all
nodes in the TSP-Link system. A status event that occurs at a subordinate node can generate an
SRQ (service request) in the master node. After detecting the service request, your program can then
branch to an appropriate subroutine that services the request. See Status byte and service request
(SRQ) (on page 12-15) for details.

Section 12: Status model

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Status model configuration example
In this example, a current limit (compliance) event in SMU A or B of node 15 sets the RQS bit of the
Status Byte of the master node. The commands to configure the status model for this example are
provided in Status configuration (enable) commands (on page 12-26).
When a current limit (compliance) condition occurs in SMU A or B of node 15, the following sequence
of events occurs:

•

Node 15: Bit B1 or B2 of the Measurement Event Current Limit Summary Register sets when the
current limit (compliance) event occurs.

•

Node 15: Bit B1 (ILMT) of the Measurement Event Register sets.

•

Node 15: Bit B0 (MSB) of the Status Byte sets.

•

System Summary Registers: Bit B1 (node 15) of the System Summary Register 2 sets.

The System Summary Registers are shared by all nodes in the TSP-Link system. When a bit in a
system register of node 15 sets, the same bit in the master node system register also sets.

•

System Summary Registers: Bit B0 (Extension) of the System Summary Register sets.

•

Master Node: Bit B0 (MSB) of the Status Byte sets.

•

Master Node: With service request enabled, bit B6 (RQS) of the Status Byte sets. When your
program performs the next serial poll of the master node, it detects the current limit event and can
branch to a routine to service the request.

The figure in Status configuration (enable) commands (on page 12-26) demonstrates the flow of
information through the status model of node 15 and the master node.

Status configuration (enable) commands
For the following registers, the commands listed, which are sent from the master node, enable the
appropriate register bits for the status model configuration example.
Node 15 status registers: The following commands enable the current limit events for SMU A and B of
node 15:
node[15].status.measurement.current_limit.enable = 6
node[15].status.measurement.enable = 2
node[15].status.node_enable = 1

Section 14
Model 2400 emulation
In this section:
Model 2400 emulation ............................................................ 14-1
Model 2400 compatibility ........................................................ 14-3

Model 2400 emulation
The 2600B provides for emulation of the Model 2400 command set using a personality script named
Persona2400. When run, this script takes control of the remote command interfaces and interprets
any commands received.

Downloading the 2400 Software Emulation script
The Model 2400 software emulation personality script is available for download from the
tek.com/keithley web page. Search for “TSP Script for Series 2600B SMUs to Emulate Model 2400
SMUs.”

Loading the 2400 Software Emulation script
Before running or configuring the script, it must be loaded into internal memory. Also, you cannot run
or load a script while a script is already running.

If the Persona2400 script has been deleted from the 2600B without using the script's DeleteScript
menu item (which is in the Configure2400 user test), you must execute the
userstring.delete("AutoRun2400") command before reloading the Persona2400 script.
To copy the script to the 2600B, you can use a flash drive or any remote command interface. If you
use a flash drive, it must be formatted as a FAT or FAT32 drive.
The script name is 2600B-800A.tsp.

Section 14: Model 2400 emulation

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

To use a flash drive to load the script to the instrument, refer to Load a script from the instrument front
panel (on page 8-5).
To use a remote command interface to load the script to the instrument, refer to Load a script by
sending commands over the remote interface (on page 8-4).

Start and configure Model 2400 emulation
To start Model 2400 emulation:
1. Press the LOAD key and then select USER from the menu.
2. Select Run2400 and press the ENTER key (if this test is not loaded, you must load the script into
internal nonvolatile memory).
3. Press the RUN key. The remote (REM) indicator lights (the script places the instrument
in remote).
To configure options for the Model 2400 emulation:
1. If a script is running, press the EXIT key to abort.
2. Press the LOAD key, then select USER from the menu and then press the ENTER key.
3. Select Configure2400 and then press the ENTER key.
4. Press the RUN key.
5. Select a menu item to configure the emulation. The available menu items are:
▪

RunAtPowerON: Select ENABLE to configure the 2600B so it automatically starts in Model
2400 emulation mode after the next power cycle. Select DISABLE to disable this option
(disables the autorun for the next power cycle). This option does not place the 2600B into
Model 2400 emulation immediately.

▪

DisplayErrors: Select YES to display error messages on the front panel as they occur; select
NO to disable this option. This setting is not retained through power cycles. This option (when
enabled) delays the script execution by approximately 2 seconds when there is an error.

▪

DeleteScript: To delete the Persona2400 script from 2600B, select YES and then turn the
instrument off and back on. This step must be performed before reloading the Persona2400
script. Select NO to cancel.

▪

Version: Select this menu item to display the Persona2400 script version.

Operating the 2600B as a Model 2400
When the script is loaded and running, the 2600B is ready to accept Model 2400 SCPI commands.
To exit out of Model 2400 emulation mode and return to 2600B normal operation, send the
DIAG:EXIT command. You can also press the EXIT key to abort the script.

Section 14: Model 2400 emulation

Execute SCPI commands when not in Model 2400 emulation
mode
You can execute SCPI commands when not in Model 2400 emulation mode. To accomplish this,
send the Initialize2400() command once and then send the Execute2400() command with
the SCPI command as a parameter in quotes. For example, to execute the SCPI
command :SOURCE:VOLTAGE 1, send Execute2400(":SOURCE:VOLTAGE 1"). If quotes are
needed in the SCPI command, use single quotes or use '\' as an escape character. For example,
send one of the following commands to execute the SCPI command :SENSE:FUNCTION
"VOLT:DC":
Execute2400(":sens:func 'VOLT:DC'")

Execute2400(":sens:func \"VOLT:DC\"")

To return to the Model 2400 emulation mode, send the Engine2400() command. After returning to
the Model 2400 emulation mode, you must execute a *RST before running any further commands.

Model 2400 compatibility
This section provides information on programming the 2600B in Model 2400 emulation mode. The
information provided includes details of general compatibility and tables that contain listings of the not
supported, partially supported, and fully supported commands.

General compatibility
Observe the following details when operating the 2600B in Model 2400 emulation mode.

Busy signal
As in a non-emulated Model 2400, the BUSY signal is active from the point that a start-of-test (SOT)
signal is received until all measurements, limit testing, and digital I/O operations have completed. To
use a BUSY signal in a non-emulated Model 2400, the binning control must be set to END. If the
trigger count is set to a value less than the number of points in the source memory sweep, the BUSY
signal indefinitely stays in the busy state. When the 2600B is in Model 2400 emulation mode, the
BUSY signal works in either binning control modes (END or IMM) if one or more of the Calculate2
limit tests are enabled and is not in the busy state indefinitely.

Source autodelay
While in Model 2400 emulation mode, when the source auto delay feature is enabled, the 2600B
source delay is used and is set to automatic delay (smua.source.delay = smua.DELAY_AUTO).

2600BS-901-01 Rev. F/August 2021

14-3

Section 14: Model 2400 emulation

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Timestamps
When the automatic timestamp reset feature is enabled, the timestamp is automatically reset when
the first measurement is made. This differs from the operation of an actual Model 2400, where the
timestamp is automatically reset when exiting the idle layer of the trigger model. This difference can
be observed when the Arm or Trigger layer event detectors are enabled.

Status word
While in Model 2400 emulation mode, the following bits of the status word are always set to zero (0):

•

Bit 2 (Front/Rear)

•

Bit 4 (OVP)

•

Bit 10 (Auto-ohms)

•

Bit 16 (Range Compliance)

•

Bit 17 (Offset Compensation)

•

Bit 18 (Contact check failure)

•

Bit 23 (Pulse Mode)

Status model
While in Model 2400 emulation mode, the following bits in the status model are always set to 0 (not
supported):
Operation Condition Register:

•

Bit 0 (Cal), bit 5 (Trig), bit 6 (Arm)

Measurement Condition Register:

•

Bit 10 (CC), bit 13 (OVP)

Questionable Condition Register:

•

Bit 14 (Warn)

Standard Event Status Register:

•

Bit 2 (QYE)

Overrange
When running a sweep while in Model 2400 emulation mode, the instrument cannot source more than
the selected source range value.

Logarithmic sweep
While in Model 2400 emulation mode, when the start and stop points of a logarithmic sweep are not
of same polarity or one of them is a zero (0), the script generates a "900" error; a non-emulated
Model 2400 does not generate this error.

Digital I/O mapping

The 2604B, 2614B, and 2634B do not have digital input/output lines.
When in Model 2400 emulation mode, digital I/O lines 1 through 9 are used to emulate different
Model 2400 lines through the digital I/O port (see Digital I/O port (on page 4-38)). The following table

How do I display the instrument's serial number?
The instrument serial number is on a label on the rear panel of the instrument. You can also access
the serial number from the front panel using the front-panel keys and menus.
To display the serial number on the front panel:
1. If the 2600B is in remote operation, press the EXIT (LOCAL) key once to place the instrument in
local operation.
2. Press the MENU key.
3. Use the navigation wheel to scroll to the SYSTEM-INFO menu item.
4. Press the ENTER key. The SYSTEM INFORMATION menu is displayed.
5. Scroll to the SERIAL# menu item.
6. Press the ENTER key. The 2600B serial number is displayed.

How do I optimize performance?
The primary factors that affect measurement accuracy and speed are:

•

Warm-up: For rated measurement accuracy, allow the 2600B to warm up for at least two hours
before use.

•

Speed setting: The speed setting affects both speed and accuracy. For more information, see
Speed (on page 2-50).

•

Autozero: Autozero can be disabled to increase speed at the expense of accuracy (for more
information, see Disabling autozero to increase speed (on page 15-2)).

Section 15: Frequently asked questions

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

Disabling autozero to increase speed
Disabling autozero (setting it to OFF) can increase measurement speed. If autozero is disabled,
accuracy drifts with time and temperature.

Turning autozero OFF disables the autozero function and possibly increases measurement speed.
To minimize drift, setting autozero to ONCE performs an autozero operation one time (when it is
selected), and then disables the autozero function. For a more detailed discussion of autozero, see
Autozero (on page 2-8).
To configure autozero from the front panel:
1. Press the CONFIG key, and then select MEAS from the menu.
2. Select AUTO-ZERO, and then press the ENTER key or the navigation wheel.
3. Select the mode (OFF, ONCE, or AUTO), and then press the ENTER key or the navigation
wheel.
4. Press the EXIT (LOCAL) key to the normal display.
Refer to Remote command autozero (on page 2-9) for details about configuring autozero from a
remote interface.

How do I upgrade the firmware?
For information on upgrading the firmware, see Upgrading the firmware.

How do I use the digital I/O port?
You can use the 2600B digital input/output with the trigger model or to control an external digital
circuit, such as a device handler used to perform binning operations. To control or configure any of
the six digital I/O lines, send commands to the 2600B over a remote interface.
Use a cable equipped with a male DB-25 connector (L-com part number CSMN25MF-5) to connect
the digital I/O port to other Keithley Instruments models equipped with a Trigger Link (TLINK).
For more information about the 2600B digital I/O port, see Digital I/O (on page 4-38).

How do I trigger other instruments?
You can use the 2600B digital input/output to control an external digital circuit, such as a device
handler used to perform binning operations. For more information about the 2600B digital I/O port,
see Digital I/O (on page 4-38).
Another option is the Keithley Instruments TSP-Link® interface, a high-speed trigger synchronization
and communication bus that you can use to connect multiple instruments in a master and subordinate
configuration. See TSP-Link System Expansion Interface (on page 8-83) for additional information.

Triggering a scanner
A typical test scenario might call for using the 2600B with a scanner to test a number of devices under
test (DUTs) in sequence. A basic example of this uses the 2600B digital I/O port to trigger a scanner
(shown in the figure below). In this example, line 1 of the digital I/O port is used as a trigger output
and connected to the scanner mainframe trigger input, and line 2 of the digital I/O port is used as a
trigger input.
Figure 148: Triggering a scanner

Interactive trigger programming
The programming example below illustrates how to set up interactive triggering. The example sets the
output trigger pulse width on line 1, then programs both lines 1 and 2 for falling edge triggers. Digital
I/O line 1 trigger asserts, and then line 2 waits for the input trigger up to the timeout period specified.
-- Set line 1 pulse width to 10 us.
digio.trigger[1].pulsewidth = 10e-6
-- Set line 1 mode to falling edge.
digio.trigger[1].mode = digio.TRIG_FALLING
-- Set line 2 mode to falling edge.
digio.trigger[2].mode = digio.TRIG_FALLING
-- Assert trigger on line 1.
digio.trigger[1].assert()
-- When complete, wait for trigger on line 2.
digio.trigger[2].wait(2)

More information about triggering
To obtain precise timing and synchronization between instruments, use the remote trigger model. For
more information about the remote trigger model and interactive triggering using other trigger objects,
see Triggering (on page 4-1).

How do I generate a GPIB service request?
For detailed information about this topic, see Status model (on page 12-1).

Setting up a service request
The exact programming steps necessary to generate a GPIB service request (SRQ) vary depending
on the events intended to generate the SRQ. In general, these steps are:
1. Clear all status registers to prevent anomalous events from generating an SRQ.
2. Set the appropriate bits in the appropriate status model enable registers.
3. Set the proper bits in the service request enable register. At least one bit in this register must
always be set, but the exact bits to be set depend on the desired SRQ events.

Service request programming example
The example below shows how to program the 2600B to generate a service request (SRQ) when the
current limit on channel A is exceeded.
-- Clear all registers.
status.reset()
-- Enable the current limit bit in the current limit register.
status.measurement.current_limit.enable = status.measurement.current_limit.SMUA
-- Enable the status measure current limit bit.
status.measurement.enable = status.measurement.ILMT
-- Enable the status SRQ MSB.
status.request_enable = status.MSB

Polling for SRQs
To determine if the 2600B is the GPIB device that generated the service request (SRQ), serial poll the
instrument for the status byte, and test to see if the corresponding summary bits are set.

Section 15: Frequently asked questions

How do I store measurements in nonvolatile memory?
After the measurements are complete, you can save the reading buffer data to the nonvolatile
memory in the instrument.
To save the reading buffer data:
1. From the front panel, press the STORE key, and then select SAVE.
2. Select INTERNAL to save to internal nonvolatile memory.
3. Select one of the following:
▪

SMUA_BUFFER1

▪

SMUA_BUFFER2

▪

SMUB_BUFFER1 (2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, and 2636B only)

▪

SMUB_BUFFER2 (2602B, 2604B, 2612B, 2614B, 2634B, and 2636B only)

4. The front panel displays Saving... This may take awhile.
5. Press the EXIT (LOCAL) key to return to the main menu.
For additional information, see Saving reading buffers (on page 3-5).

When should I change the output-off state?
Carefully consider and configure the appropriate output-off state, source function, and
compliance limits before connecting the 2600B to a device that can deliver energy (for
example, other voltage sources, batteries, capacitors, solar cells, or other 2600B
instruments). Configure recommended instrument settings before making connections to the
device. Failure to consider the output-off state, source, and compliance limits may result in
damage to the instrument or to the device under test (DUT).
The 2600B instrument provides multiple output-off states. The multiple states are required because
different types of connected devices (or loads) require different behaviors from the 2600B when its
output is turned off. Therefore, careful selection of the proper output-off state is important to prevent
damage to devices and instruments. This is especially true when the device can deliver energy to the
2600B, such as a battery or capacitor or when another SourceMeter instrument is connected across
the output terminals. In these situations, you should use an output-off state that isolates the
instrument from the device by either setting smuX.source.offfunc = smuX.OUTPUT_DCAMPS or
smuX.source.offfunc = smuX.OUTPUT_DCVOLTS, as applicable.
For example, a passive device such as a diode is not affected by a 0 V source connected across its
terminals when the output is turned off. However, connecting a 0 V source to the terminals of a
battery causes the battery to discharge.
There are other guidelines to follow when connecting the output of multiple 2600B instruments to get
a larger current or voltage. Please refer to the following references for more information:

Series 2600B System SourceMeter® instrument Reference Manual

How do I make contact check measurements?
The Models 2604B, 2614B, and 2634B do not perform contact check measurements.
For information about making contact check measurements, see Contact check measurements (on
page 2-22) and Contact check (on page 2-7).

How do I make low-current measurements?
Low-current measurements (<1 mA) are subject to errors caused by leakage currents and leakage
resistances in the signal path. Model 2634B, 2635B, and 2636B instruments are equipped with triaxial
connectors to minimize these problems. To assure accurate low-level measurements, the integrity of
the signal path must be maintained to the device under test (DUT), including using both low-noise
triaxial cables and a suitable test fixture.

Low-current connections
The figure below shows typical connections for low-current measurements. The DUT in this example
could be a low-current semiconductor device, a high-megohm resistor, or any other passive or active
electronic device requiring low-current measurements. Note that the DUT is enclosed in both a guard
shield and a safety shield.
The inner shield (guard) of the HI triaxial cable is connected to the test fixture guard shield. The guard
shield prevents leakage currents from affecting the measurements. The outer cable shield (chassis
ground or protective earth (safety ground)) is connected to the safety shield.

A safety shield must be used whenever hazardous voltages (>30 VRMS, 42 VPEAK) will be
present in the test circuit. To prevent electrical shock that could cause injury or death, never
use the 2600B in a test circuit that may contain hazardous voltages without a properly
installed and configured safety shield.
Connect the enclosure of all metal test fixtures to protective earth (safety ground).
Nonconductive test fixtures must be rated to double the maximum capability of the test
equipment in the system. Failure to attach the ground wires to a known protective earth may
result in electric shock.

How can I change the line frequency or voltage?
The 2600B requires a line voltage of 100 V ac to 240 V ac (±10%) and a line frequency of 50 Hz or
60 Hz. The factory configures the 2600B to automatically detect and operate at the appropriate power
line frequency each time the instrument power is turned on. In noisy environments, it may be
necessary to manually configure the instrument to match the actual line frequency. For more
information, see Line frequency configuration.
To configure the line frequency from the front panel:
1. Press the MENU key, then turn the navigation wheel to select LINE-FREQ, and then press the
ENTER key.
2. Turn the navigation wheel to select the appropriate frequency and then press the ENTER key. To
configure the instrument to automatically detect line frequency at each power-up, select AUTO.
3. Press the EXIT (LOCAL) key to return to the main display.

Section 15: Frequently asked questions

To configure the line frequency from a remote interface:
Set the localnode.linefreq or the localnode.autolinefreq attribute. To set the line
frequency to 60 Hz, send:
localnode.linefreq = 60

To configure the instrument to automatically detect line frequency at each power-up:
localnode.autolinefreq = true

Where can I get the LabVIEW driver?
The latest NITM LabVIEWTM driver is available on tek.com/keithley.

What should I do if I get an 802 interlock error?
You receive error code 802, "OUTPUT blocked by interlock," if you:

•

Disengage the interlock when the 2600B output is already on.

•

Attempt to turn on the 2600B output when the interlock is disengaged.

To recover from this error, properly engage the interlock using a safe test fixture, and then turn on the
2600B output.

Why is the reading value 9.91e37?
This value indicates that there is a measurement overflow error. This error occurs when:

•

A measurement performed on a fixed range has a measured value greater than the specified
range

•

The measured value is larger than the maximum current or voltage range of the instrument
(exceeds the instrument rating)

If the instrument displays the overflow message on a particular range, select a higher range until an
on-range reading is displayed. To ensure the best accuracy and resolution, use the lowest range
possible that does not cause an overflow.

Where can I find the Model 2400 emulation script?
The 2600B provides for emulation of the Model 2400 command set using an emulation script. When
run, this script takes control of the remote command interfaces and interprets any commands
received.
The Model 2400 software emulation personality script is available for download from the
tek.com/keithley web page. Search for “TSP Script for Series 2600B SMUs to Emulate Model 2400
SMUs.”
Refer to Model 2400 emulation (on page 14-1) for additional information about using the emulation
script.
